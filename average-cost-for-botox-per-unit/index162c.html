<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Average cost for Botox ranges from $12-$15 per unit. Typical treatment areas require 20 units, but this is very patient dependent whether you have a larger area forehead or if you have very strong muscles.</p><p>Our office charges “per area” assuming 20 units per area. If I need less number of units for a patient, I simply deduct the cost for the amount of units I actually use. Dysport usually runs $50 less. (Azin Meshkinpour, MD, MPH, FAAD, Lake Forest Dermatologist)</p><p>The cost of Botox may vary depending upon geographic location.</p><p>The average cost for Botox is $11 to $12 in the Tampa Bay region. (Jeremy A. Benedetti, MD, Saint Petersburg Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is used to reduce lines and wrinkles from around the face. It can also be used to reduce headaches or migraines from relaxing the muscles around the forehead or in the neck.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1641" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-2240a3b88f35be89b5b951ceaf8d3b67">

</div><p>Our Botox cost is $10.50 per unit. I inject all Botox on my patients and with a consultation, I can determine the amount needed. We’ll look at the areas where you have concern and evaluate the number of units you may need.</p><p>I am always on the conservative side with injecting Botox for patients. Once I determine the number of units that will be needed, I’ll make sure you feel comfortable and then will begin the injection to get the results you are looking for.</p><p>An average number of units is around 20-24, just to get an idea of cost. Sometimes a patient may not need as many or may require more units. Botox typically lasts 3 months. (Jeffrey M.

</div><p>Some doctors charge per unit and others charge per area. Per unit in Beverly Hills most will charge around $15/unit while they might offer $10/unit during holidays or discounts. The forehead for most women requires about 20 units on average.</p><p>The Glabella or 11’s requires 25-30 units on average. The Crow’s feet require 25 units combined on average, so about 12.5 units per side. An important thing to note from doctor to doctor is the concentration of the solution they are using.</p><p>More concentrated is preferable in my hands for many reasons, but this varies from doctor to doctor. From my experience with patients and friends, the most reliable indicator for finding a good injector physician is word of mouth.</p><p>Most people have been injected by more than one physician and on more than one occasion. When those people get injected by physicians with varying degrees of talent they realize it. Unlike surgical photos, before and after photos of botox injections are not a reliable indicator.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1643" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There is no magic to botox injections – just knowing the patient’s anatomy and the patient’s needs very very well will provide a great outcome. (Ben Talei, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Average cost of Botox</h5><p>In the Denver/Boulder area, most practices charge between $10-15 per unit. If you have never had Botox before, it is difficult to gauge what that means in how much a treatment would be. Depending on the area to be treated – I generally recommend 25-50 units.</p><p>This may come out to $300-600 for a treatment. Prices may differ by community and by provider. Often times in a practice where there is a physician and a nurse injector, the physician treatment can be expected to cost a little more.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1644" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>I caution patients to be wary of a deal that looks too good to be true. As the cliche phrase goes . cheap botox is never good and good botox is never cheap. Make sure you seek treatment by a licensed and trained professional. (Catherine Weng, MD, Denver Otolaryngologist)</p><h4>Cost varies, but is usually around $10/unit</h4><p>It depends on the area, but the average price is $10/unit, and most patients get anywhere from 10 to 30 units, on average. There is sometimes a $50 injection fee on top of the unit price, but if you look around you can usually find some special deals. (Ross Blagg, MD, Austin Physician)</p><h5>You are paying for the Experience of the Injector Not the Botox</h5><p>The most important factor when getting Botox© is: Who is injecting the Botox©? Is it a Nurse? Is it a Doctor? Is the Doctor a Board Certified Physician with specific training in the field?</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1645" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Experience matters and so does the anatomical knowledge of the area.</p><p>There are countless “stories” of Botox© being injected into the wrong area or causing unwanted effects. Sometimes the individual doing the injection just went to a “Weekend-Course” and decided to start offering the procedure. The old motto: “You Get What You Pay For” holds especially true in this scenario.</p><p>What does that mean for cost? Recently, Botox© has been raising their price yearly. Currently, Botox© falls around $10-14/unit ($12/unit is average) depending on the knowledge and experience of your injector. Another, and very reasonable option, is to utilize Dysport© or Xeomin©. They are also a neuromodulator and have similar effects/results; but the price point is lower. (Matthew J. Nykiel, MD, California Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1646" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Botox costs vary from service provider to service provider. The costs can range from $8-$16 per unit with $10-$12 being the average. Our office typically charges by the area $300 (25-30 units) and we guarantee our results, so you do not pay if you would like a top up on your Botox (i.e.: additional units in that same area) after the results take effect. (Cory Torgerson, MD, PhD, FRCSC, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Costs can vary quit a bit depending upon your area of the country. For us locally in the Philadelphia Tri State area it can range from $8 to $16 per unit. Our practice feels that is is best to price a patient “per unit” as opposed to “per area”; our moto is you are paying for only what you receive while following the proper dilution recommendation of the manufacturer.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1647" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-69d878c2edf505f6450abc6b78aa38f5">

</div><p>Though we know price can be a factor for someone when beginning their research, you want to also focus on the experience of the person injecting. On average we find that patients spent between $375 to $675 to achieve their desired optimal results. (Calvin Wilson, MD, Philadelphia OB-GYN)</p><p>BOTOX Cosmetic is priced by the unit, and prices are set by practitioners and often reflect their levels of experience. On average, you can expect to pay between $10 and $16 per unit. The total cost depends on how many units you require.</p><p>Your surgeon or injector can give you a better idea of what you can expect to pay during a face-to-face consultation. (Howard Silverman, MD, FRCSC, Ottawa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>We charge for Botox by the unit, because I think you should get what you pay for. Botox can range depending on the area of the country and the expertise of the injector. Non-plastic surgeons often offer Botox for as little as $7 a unit, whereas highly trained plastic surgeons may charge $15/Unit or more.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1648" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I would say the average in the Atlanta area is around $12 a unit. Make sure you go to a reputable place and don’t just shop for the best bargain. You get what you pay for. (Brian Arslanian, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The price is usually dependent upon the number of units injected. That can vary greatly. You can possibly get what seems a cheaper price sometimes but the botox may be diluted more with less long acting effects.</p><p>Prices per unit can run from $11 to $15 average and if doing the 3 areas of the face done most frequently you typically use between 50 -60 units. (Walton Montegut, MD, Newport Beach Physician)</p><p>The price for botox can vary by who is performing the injections and how they charge. In our practice only the plastic surgeons inject botox. You can charge by the area or by the unit.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1649" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>We charge by the unit, our practice charges $14/unit of botox. So the average price of botox can range from $350-$600. (Timothy Treece, MD, FACS, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>On average Botox should cost around 15$ per unit. The doctor could also charge by the area, and that price varies depending who is injecting. (Philip J. Miller, MD, FACS, New York Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>On average Botox ranges from $10- $14 per unit. Some practices will incentivise you to buy more Botox by providing a lower cost for 40+ units. Rarely you will find Botox as low as $9 dollars per unit, but be cautious where you receive Botox because it is still a medication. (Margaret (Migs) Muldrow, MD, Denver Dermatologist)</p><h4>Montreal Botox Prices</h4><p>In Montreal, Botox is usually charged per unit, with the average being$15/unit for a treatment with an experienced injector. It’s difficult to say without an evaluation, but I would estimate that you’d require a treatment of 40-50 units total for all 3 areas.</p><p>Be wary about discounts or a very low price per unit when it comes to Botox or injectables in general. Pricing is usually dependent on the expertise of the injector as well as the qualifications of the provider (i.e. physical specialist versus a nurse or spa injector). In this industry especially ‘you pay for what you get’ and I would not recommend potentially compromising your health and well-being to save a few dollars. (Steven Bernstein, MD, Montreal Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox cost varies</h4><p>The most important fact is to find a qualified physician for your injection. The price may vary on the average from 150-300$ per area. For example one area is considered between the eye brows or the forehead or the crows feet.</p><p>But please make sure the individual is well trained and qualified to do the injection. Best is to get a referral from friends and then check the credentials. (Amir Moradi, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
