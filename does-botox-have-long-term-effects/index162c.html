<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h5>3-4 Months Usually</h5><p>Botox usually lasts around 12-16 weeks. The loss of the Botox effect depends primarily on internal issues (the effectiveness of your immune system with specific regard to this specific chemical substance) rather than any other issues that you have control over. (Bruce Saal, MD, Los Gatos Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox has a variable length of effect.</b></p><p>Botox, or botulinum toxin, is a protein that when injected in various areas of facial muscle expression cause weaking of the muscles. It is a temporary effect that tends to last about 3 months at a time.</p><p>Routine use of Botox can cause prolonged weakening of these muscles causing atrophy of these muscles. I have patients that now come in on a yearly basis because their muscles have chronically weakened over time.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_137" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Because the injection of any protein can cause the formation of antibodies, some patients experience a different long term effect of Botox use. They note that their Botox doesn’t last as long, or it takes more units of Botox to get the same end effect.</p><p>For these patients, it is best to try other brands of botulinum toxin such as Dysport or Xeomin. (Manish H. Shah, MD, FACS, Denver Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox lasts longer the more you use it</b></p><p>Botox is one of the cosmetic treatments I enjoy most. Almost every patient is happy! Most of my long-term users notice that the more they use it, the longer it lasts. This is because if you do not use your muscle, it actually decreases in size (making it harder to make those frowns!). (Tracy Kuykendall, MD, Tulsa Dermatologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_138" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Botox lasts around three months but varies person to person. There are some that only see six weeks of maximal effect and then start to see it wear off while others see it work for 6 to 12 months.</p><p>Definitely over time with repetive injections the results last longer and longer. Probably this is due to a combination of weakening of the muscles injected, breaking the habit of making the facial expression, and remodeling of the wrinkles. (Katrinka L. Heher, MD, Boston Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox Longivity</b></p><p>The duration of effect of Botox varies from patient to patient. Most note 3-4 months of effect. If too low a dose is used it will not last as long. After many years of usage I have not noted many patients that began to have longer intervals of effectiveness with prolonged use.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_139" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>But on the other side I have not noted many patients to require higher and higher dosage needs to get the same effect, a condition known as tachyphylaxis. Fortunately this does not appear to occur in most individuals. (Maurice M. Vick, Jr., MD, Baton Rouge Urologist)</p><p>On average Botox lasts 3 to 4 months. There are some patients who notice longer or shorter durations in the effect. There’s nothing that can be done to increase the duration, but proper placement of Botox within the target muscle is important.</p><p>Make sure that your injector has good experience with the use of Botox an understanding of facial anatomy. (Austin Hayes, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Administration of Botox and similar medications is expected to reduce or eliminate the ability of targeted muscles to contract. The duration of effect ranges from 2 to 6 months with most obtaining desired improvement for 3 to 4 months.(J. David Holcomb, MD, Sarasota Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_140" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>The amount of time it lasts can be quite variable. In general, you should expect the effect to last about 3-4 months, at which point you may desire repeat treatment. With time, many patients find themselves needing fewer units and the effect lasting longer, but this does not happen for everyone. (Bryan Correa, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>How long Botox usually lasts</b></p><p>For the average patient, Botox lasts around 3 months. We try and keep our patients on a revolving 3 month schedule so that the muscles stay relaxed. This can also have a prophylactic effect to prevent other wrinkles from forming.</p><p>Botox is a quick and easy procedure that can help you look years younger within a few days. Keep in mind that it can take up to a week to see the full results. It is not a permanent treatment, and the effects will gradually wear off over a few months. (Lawrence Bundrick, MD, Huntsville Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_141" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><strong>Botox, maximum duration of effects</strong></p><p>Botox, generally lasts for 3-6 months. Althought with successive multiple injections, muscles can be more relaxed & due to long term effect of not using these muscles, effect can last longer but actual effect of Botox lasts not more than 6 months. (M. Khawar Nazir, MBBS, MS(Derm), Pakistan Dermatologist)</p><p>The effects of Botox will last between 4 to 6 months, this will vary from patient to patient. As the muscle action gradually returns, the lines and wrinkles will begin to reappear and need to be treated again.</p><p>The lines and wrinkles often appears less severe with time because the muscles are atrophy. (Todd Ginestra, MD (in memoriam), Clermont Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Generally speaking, Botox lasts 3-4 months</i></p><p>There is of course variability between patients; however generally speaking Botox lasts 3-4 months. In some patients, the effect may last up to 6 months; others may see the toxin “wear off” in 10 weeks (Anand G. Shah, MD, San Antonio Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_142" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-9ae2f743da18db5fa561f2cd26cb2709">

</div><p>Botox usually lasts 3-6 months in most patients. However, it may not last less or it may last longer. Personally, I have seen results up to one year. Longevity of effects is individual and may change (increase or decrease) with repeat use.</p><p>Botox is a very popular, effective and safe procedure when performed by an experienced physician. (Robert Strimling, MD, Las Vegas Dermatologist)</p><p>Botox typically lasts 3-4 months for most patients. In some people, the effects of Botox may last for a shorter or longer period of time. I have a few patients who need repeat treatment every 2-3 months because it just does not seem to last as long for them.</p><p>(I usually give these patients a price break to help with the cost of frequent injections). On the other hand, I have some patients (the lucky ones!) who only need to come in once a year for their repeat Botox treatment.</p><p>I see Botox as an essential part of a good skincare program. Botox prevents lines and wrinkles from forming in first place. For most patients, my goal is not a frozen look but instead to provide softening of lines and a natural result.</p><p>I like to start conservative with my dose and add more later if needed. I like to tell my patients in my Denver practice that I can add more at any time but I can’t take it out.</p><p>I also offer as a courtesy to all my patients that they return at 1-2 weeks after treatment for a check of their results. If they need a small touch-up, I provide this at no additional charge. (Richard Ort, MD, Lone Tree Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>The effects of Botox range from two to six months, but the average duration of effectiveness is three to four months. However, this is dependent on the patient, the dilution rate, the number of units injected and the injection technique.</p><p>I recommend that you receive your injections from an experienced physician injector for optimal results. (E. John Serrao, MD, Orlando OB-GYN)</p><p><strong>Duration of Botox effect</strong></p><p></p>

</div>Typically, the effect from Botox lasts approximately 3 to 4 months. There is also a belief that if a patient receives Botox injections over an extended period, the duration of effect increases. I will tell you that I have many patients who still have improvement for longer than 4 months. (Ryan Greene, MD, PhD, Fort Lauderdale Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Botox lasts between 3-4 months generally. Proper handling and placement of the Botox can optimize its effect. The best placement for injections is typically done by dermatologists or plastic surgeons that are certified Expert Injectors. (David J. Myers, MD, Salt Lake City Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>The desired effect of botox or dysport usually lasts about 3-4 months. If you get injections regularly, sometimes you are able to achieve the same result with less frequent injections. (Gary Goldenberg, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p>The treatment takes three to eight days to take full effect. Results vary, however visible results usually last from 3 to 5 months. The best time for retreatment is when you start to see movement of the muscles that were originally treated.</p><p>If you are able to retreat at that time, the muscles will get smaller and the time between treatments will be longer. Be sure to talk to your healthcare provider about what you can expect. (Steven Gabel, MD, FACS, Portland Hair Restoration Surgeon)</p></div>
