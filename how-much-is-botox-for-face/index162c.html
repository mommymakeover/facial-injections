<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The price of Botox varies from surgeon to surgeon. Some offer per unit pricing while others offer pricing by treatment region on the face.</p><p>Geography also factors in as well. You want to go with a provider who knows the anatomy of the region around your eyes and face that you are interested in improving as well as choose the provider you feel most comfortable with.</p><p>Most patients feel that they want a physician specializing in eyelid or facial plastics only to inject them, while others may comfortable with another provider. (Sean Paul, MD, Austin Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h5>What Does Botox Cost</h5><p>The price of a Botox treatment varies depending on the amount of Botox needed to get the desired result or the number of areas of your face that are treated.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1605" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There is also different prices in different regions of the country.</p><p>Finally the price varies from doctor to doctor. Of course, price is an important factor to many people.</p><p>However it seems that your question implies that it might be the only factor. It is very important to realize that Botox is not a product that you are buying off of the shelf.</p><p>It is a treatment the requires a great deal of skill, experience, and artistry. There is no doubt that the quality of your results depends on who does your treatment.</p><p>That doesn’t mean that the more you pay, the better the results.</p><p>But it does mean that you should try a determine which doctor is right for you based on many factors. I would suggest trying to get a recommendation from your physician or a friend. Online reviews are also helpful.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1606" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Your best bet may be to meet some doctors who perform this treatment in your area and see who makes you comfortable during your visit. (Marc Cohen, MD, Philadelphia Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox costs may vary widely. Why? It likely has to do with who is doing the injection. Your safest bet is a physician who knows facial anatomy very well and can avoid complications. (Anand D. Patel, MD, Brookfield Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Knoxville Botox</strong></p><p>Physicians usually charge by the area or per unit. I have found charging by the unit to be less confusing for the patient. I charge $10.50 per unit. The price can vary in any particular city based on who’s injecting it (MD vs physician extender), expertise and experience of the injector, and any specials they are running.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1607" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I highly recommend having a physician perform your Botox injections. Their knowledge of facial anatomy is greater, they understand that not every face is “standard” and that not every muscle needs the same number of units, and they can easily manage any complications that may arise. (Clyde Mathison, MD, Knoxville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>The Cost Of Botox For Face</h5><p>In general, offices charge for Botox injections by two methods: either based on the area of the face being injected, e.g., the forehead, or by the number of units injected.</p><p>We believe it is more transparent for patients to be charged by the unit, since patients with different anatomy, and different patterns of skin wrinkles, will require different amounts of Botox to treat each area.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1608" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>On a per unit basis, the amount charged for Botox in Southern California can range from $8-$20. Part of the reason why this range is so broad is that when a patient pays for an injection of Botox, she is not just paying for the cost of the Botox itself, but also for the training, experience and skill of the medical professional injecting the Botox, as well as for any after care needed following the injection. (Peter Lee, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I personally do not charge a patient by the area injected and instead charge by the unit. I do this because there is too much variability between patients — different people require different quantities of Botox in different areas to get similar results.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1609" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b527d53b3c9f8347f60fc0f1d1176e70">

</div><p>A simple example is the following – a man in his 30s will likely have a stronger set of facial muscles than a young woman in her 20s. He will thus need more Botox than the girl to obtain a similar result.</p><p>It would be unfair to charge the woman the same price as the man just because she is getting the same “area” treated, because she will quite simply need less Botox…</p><p>In my practice, I spend a significant amount of time with my patient to fully evaluate their facial muscle strength, demonstrate what I predict the result with be after the Botox, and clearly show the variability in the muscle and bone anatomy from one side of the face to the other.</p><p>No two faces are the same, and the face is rarely completely symmetric. One point I stress to all prospective Botox patients is to make sure they do their research when it pertains to their physician injector.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1610" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>The experience of the physician is more important than the price of the Botox. I think the key lies in truly understanding the anatomy of the injected area, and more importantly the variability in the anatomy between patients — for brows, the forehead and anywhere else you plan on receiving a Botox injection.</p><p>This includes having a firm understanding of the origin, insertion, and action of each muscle that will be injected, the thickness of each muscle targeted, and the patient variability therein. As a plastic surgeon, I am intrinsically biased since I operate in the area for browlifts and facelifts, and have a unique perspective to the muscle anatomy since I commonly dissect under the skin and see the actual muscles themselves.</p><p>For me, this helps guide where to inject and where not to. However, with that said, I know many Dermatologists who know the anatomy well despite not operating in that area, and get great results.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1611" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It should not be the price of the Botox, but the experience and education of the individual physician that should guide where you receive your Botox treatment. Always remember, you get what you pay for. (Mark K. Markarian, MD, MSPH, Boston Physician)</p><p><i>How much does Botox cost? It varies</i></p><p>First, it is important to know that injectors charge for Botox in two different ways:</p><ol>
<li>By area</li>
<li>By unit (more common)</li>
</ol><p>Don’t be surprised if you are quoted a “per unit” price by one injector, and a “per area” price by another.</p><p>This is just two different and legitimate ways to approach the same problem. Second, some patients will require Botox more frequently than others. On average, Botox lasts about 3 months – but some will require Botox every 2 months, whereas others only need injections every 4 months.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1612" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>This factor can affect how much you need to spend over time. As for the cost of Botox at one visit, the following factors tend to have an impact:</p><ol>
<li>The injector’s level of training and expertise</li>
<li>The geographic location of the injector</li>
<li>Whether there are any ongoing specials or online deals that are applicable.</li>
</ol><p>On average, Botox is generally priced from $10 – 20.</p><p>Like anything else: when it comes to Botox, sometimes its too good to be true. “Cheap” Botox may cost your more in the long run as it could mean the injector is inexperienced or the product is expired.</p><p>Make sure to go to a highly-trained specialist who understands the anatomy of your face and is an injection expert. (Jonathan Cabin, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1613" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><strong>Botox costs depend on various factors including the skill of the practitioner</strong></p><p>Fees are related to the number of units used or the number of areas on the face or body. In the UK, most usually the fees we charge are on the number of areas treated and the reputation of the practitioner.</p><p>Try not to be lured by the promise of cut price treatments or heavy discounts as you cannot put a price on safety and experience. Dr Tracy Mountford (Tracy Mountford, MBBS, London Physician)</p><p>In my practice we charge per unit instead of per area. I feel this more fair to the patient as some patients have less active muscles than others and need less product. Also women need less than men for the same treated area.</p><p>I spent a lot of time educating my patients about Botox for face, the way it works and how each face is different than the other and also sometimes for the same patient one side will need more than the other if the patient has a baseline asymmetry.</p><p>Botox prices vary based on the location of the practice, the experience of the injector etc… it is very important to seek someone you trust over how much they charge. (Bernard S. Salameh, MD, Bowling Green Physician)</p><p>The price of Botox varies greatly for a variety of reasons. First, the cost will vary based on how many areas on your face you are trying to treat. For example, some patients only want to get rid of their crow’s feet, while others want to get rid of crow’s feet, 11 lines, forehead lines, etc.</p><p>So I would need to know exactly what areas you wanted to treat so I could determine how many units of Botox you would need to give you an accurate cost. The next component of pricing is the credentials and level of experience of the physician who is injecting you.</p><p>There are many different types of people who are qualified to injection Botox, ranging from nurses to board certified plastic surgeons. The cost of having Botox injections with a nurse will obviously be lower than with a board certified plastic surgeon.</p><p>The most important thing is to find an injector who has a very safe and strong track record with their Botox injections. You want to make sure someone with a lot of experiencing is performing your injections because Botox is not reversible.</p><p>Once it is injected, you have to live with the results until it wears off in 3 – 4 months. So an inexperienced injector could leave you with drooping brows or another unwanted appearance. (Jimmy S. Firouz, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox Pricing for Face</em></p><p>Our office charges by the unit. We offer Botox for $12 a unit but if you purchase 50 or more units the prices becomes $10.00. We also offer rebate programs through Brilliant Distinctions. We also bank units and have specials running in our laser center monthly for services we offer. Typically you to treat three areas of the face you need 50-60 unit total. (Robert D. Wilcox, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
