(Mariusz Gajewski, MBBS, Sydney Physician)</p><p>Botox lasts as long as it takes for your muscles to reconnect to the nerves that make them contract.</p><p>For most people, this is 3-4 months. Injections every 3-4 months keep the muscles still, and this prevents wrinkling from continuing to worsen.

<li>The area/target tissue treated (i.e.; muscles vs sweat glands, and even different muscles)</li>
<li>The dose used (larger doses tend to result in longer duration)</li>
<li>The number of previous treatments (treating areas consistently tends to result in longer duration of action for a given dose)</li>
<li>Injecting technique and product placement (accurate injecting technique gives better results)</li>
<li>And your own body – duration of action can significantly vary from person to person.</li>
</ol><p>A good practitioner will be able to estimate the duration of effect depending on the area to be treated and dosage chosen, as well as work with you over time to maintain the desired effect in the most efficient way.

</div>Typically, it will last anywhere from 3-4 months. It is not uncommon to have some variation based on how your body regenerates the nerve receptors; also it is not an instantaneous thing when the muscle start working.
<p>More commonly, people notice some movement start to come back at 2.5-3 months. Another common pattern is that people develop a tolerance so after several years, I have had some patients say that their Botox wears off faster. (Sapna A. Patel, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox results typically last 3-4 months. However, every individual is different in the way your body reacts with the product. As a general rule, you will want to get a touch up of botox every 3-4 months.</p><p>To be sure, see two or more experienced, licensed and board-certified providers in your area for a complete evaluation to make sure you are a good candidate and that it is safe for you to have treatment.

Jason Wendel, MD, FACS, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_802" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>On average, Botox lasts 3 to 4 months in most patients before it wears off and needs to be re-injected in order to maintain the results.</p><p>Of course, this varies from one patient to the next, with some patients’ results lasting a shorter amount of time and others lasting up to 6 months (although both of these are uncommon).</p><p>Many patients that have consistent injections over several years seem to get longer-lasting results, likely due to several factors including muscle atrophy, relaxation of deep skin creases, and “un-learning” of particular facial expressions that cause wrinkles. (Matthew Richardson, MD, Frisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is an excellent anti-wrinkle treatment and works by binding to the nerve that causes the muscle to contract. The effect of this lasts an average of 3-4 months although there are a number of factors that determine the length of effect.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_803" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-46a7d68de0a0382e26b3962f4469d5d5">

</div><p>The strength of the muscle, age, genetics, metabolism and how long you have been treating the area all have an impact on how long your treatment lasts. For example, Botox lasts longer in people who have been using it regularly, as over a period of time the muscle will atrophy (become less strong) and so the Botox could last up to 6 months.</p><p>Most people are happy with 3 or 4 treatments per year. A higher dose of Botox does not necessarily correlate with a longer lasting treatment. As always, the best advice is to seek a highly qualified and dedicated aesthetic medical practitioner who can guide you towards the most appropriate options and results for you. (Tracy Mountford, MBBS, London Physician)</p><p>Botox can take up to two weeks to see full results. Many patients see the most change within three to seven days with a little more softening of fine lines and wrinkles around day fourteen.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_804" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Patients can have Botox placed every three months. Majority of patients have Botox placed every three to four months, before they fully return to their “baseline,” so that existing fine lines and wrinkles do not deepen and to prevent new ones from forming. (Spencer Berry, MD, Fargo Family Physician)</p><p>In my opinion, for new users Botox lasts around 3 months as the muscle is still hyperactive. For patient who have been using Botox more than 2 years, Botox usually lasts longer than 3 months as the muscle is weaker in these patients. (Dr. Salameh, Plastic Surgeon, Bowling Green, KY). (Bernard S. Salameh, MD, Bowling Green Physician)</p><p>Botox will last three to four months, however, I’ve found in my practice, that with consistent treatment, effects will last longer because the muscle will be trained over time to be less active. If you come back in four months, the next treatment will probably last longer, and this increases each time.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_805" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It’s like muscle atrophy. If you don’t use any muscle for a long time, it gets weaker and weaker. The converse is also true. If you have have Botox, then wait a long time, the muscle has had an opportunity to regain its strength, and the process of weakening that muscle starts over again. (Wendy Epstein, MD, FAAD, Nyack Dermatologist)</p><h4>The average is 3-4 months</h4><p>Botox Cosmetic lasts, on average, 3-4 months. There are a number of factors that can contribute to how long it lasts, however. The type of injector you see can determine how long the Botox will work.</p><p>It is important to go to a core specialist for Botox, meaning a board certified plastic surgeon or dermatologist. First, they have been trained in the underlying structures and anatomy of the face and therefore, tend to be more equipped to do the injections to maximize their efficacy.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_806" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Second, you want to make sure you see someone who does a lot of Botox injections – the Botox will be fresher and thus more effective.(Jason Brett Lichten, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox Longevity Depends on Several Factors </b></p><p>Botox typically lasts anywhere from two to six months. The effectiveness of Botox is dependent on several factors, including the amount of Botox used, the area being treated, and the number of Botox treatment sessions a patient undergoes.</p><p>In addition, the age and health of the individual will also contribute to the effects of Botox and their temporal lifespan. (Andre Berger, MD, Beverly Hills Physician)</p><h4>Typically Botox lasts about 4 months.</h4><p>I recommend people should consider having treatments between 3-4 times a year to ensure the best rejuvenating results and also to help break the habit of unnecessary frowning.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_807" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-2ed72acc3c6f6879385f8f3b03fad962">

</div><p>I advise my patients that they could be a 3 monther, or a 4 monther, or a 5 monther, or rarely a 6 monther. 95% of people are 4 months. (Ravi Jain, MBBS, London Physician)</p><p>Botox will typically last around 4 months – but that is an estimate and depends on several factors</p><ol>
<li>how active are you? if you are a long distance runner, your Botox will likely not last as long</li>
<li>how many wrinkles do you already have? If you are using Botox as a preventative for wrinkles, you can probably go 9-12 months between treatments.</li>
</ol><p>If you are using Botox to soften lines that have already etched due to animation, you will need to use it more frequently (Jack Peterson, MD, Topeka Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>How long does Botox last?</h5><p>It depends on the individual. Botox works by blocking motor (movement) nerves, and it “wears off” when the body regrows these nerves. Different people regrow nerves at different rates, which is the primary factor determining how long Botox lasts.</p><p>The majority of patients will notice that the Botox wears off between 2 and 4 months. The way Botox is injected can also affect how long it lasts. If the Botox is injected incorrectly, some or most of it can be wasted by not entering the muscle directly.</p><p>If this occurs, the patient will notice less effect from the Botox, and it could quite possibly last a shorter period time. In addition, the way Botox is mixed, its freshness and care with refrigeration can all impact how long it lasts.</p><p>This is why it is important to find a well-trained plastic surgeon (or dermatologist) who has expertise in the facial muscles and understands how to properly deal with the Botox. Even though you may find “cheaper” Botox with day spas or non-medical practices, you may end up spending more money in the long run because of misplaced injections or mistreated product!
