<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The longevity of the Botox will vary from patient to patient. I find the average is 3 to 4 months in most patients. It can vary by how many units you got during your treatment and how fresh your Botox product is , that is used in your treatment.</p><p>Botox on average typically lasts 3-4 months. How long it lasts, however, depends on a variety of issues. First and foremost, every patient is different.</p><p>I have had patients coming to me for years for Botox who still, unfortunately, need it every three months.</p><p>Others, whether it is the first time or their tenth time, will find that they need it less often, sometimes as infrequently as every 6-8 months. In addition, what dose is used definitely affects how long it lasts.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_128" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Using a dose to just relax the muscles will often mean less longer lasting results. A more complete freeze of the muscles can lead to longer lasting results.</p><p>What is great about Botox is that, fortunately, treatments are usually a minimal down time procedure with many patients doing it over their lunch.</p><p>It requires only 10 minutes of treatment time ; Botox is a great option for those looking to tweak their appearance with almost no down time. (Hardik Soni, MD (not currently practicing), Summit Emergency Medicine Physician)</p><p>The first time you get Botox, it should last approximately 2 1/2 to 3 months. Once you begin to notice the movement of the forehead muscles returning, I would go back to your plastic surgeon and get your next treatment.</p><p>If you do this, the effect of the Botox seems to last longer and you may begin to start getting 3 1/2 to 4 months out of every treatment. The longest Botox can last is 6 months but very few patients have this long of an effect. (Mike Majmundar, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_129" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><b>How long will Botox last?</b></p><p>I believe that a patient who’s having Botox for the first time usually thinks their treatment lasts 6 months or upwards and when they have it done again feel that the Botox ‘didn’t last as long?!’ this is because the first time you get injected your muscles are being trained, if you will, not to move and physiologically the patient is more aware of the effects during and after their first treatment.</p><p>How Botox works is by irreversibly binding to receptors that send nerve signals for muscles to contract. However, your body makes new receptors & neurotransmitters all the time, so each patient will have different lengths of effective paralysis.</p><p>2-6 months is the range; average though is 3-4 months. Then there’s the skill and accuracy of the injector.</p><p>Since Botox works where it’s placed, the more accurate your injector is with the target muscles, the better! With this treatment, I really do believe that you get what you pay for and should not be sold a special offer or deal.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_130" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>A favourite quote i heard many years ago is very apt here….’the bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten!’ (Kambiz Golchin, MBBS, FRCS (Eng), FRCS(ORL-HNS), London Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>3-4 months</strong></p><p>In brief, most patients will have lasting results for 3-4 months after the injection. Some may have a little more while fewer will have even less.</p><p>We have found that it is fairly consistent though, if it lasts 4 months the first time it typically lasts 4 months every time.</p><p>Nancy, our nurse practitioner who specializes in Botox injections usually tells our patients to plan on getting Botox treatments three times per year for maintenance. (Mark E. Freeman, MD, Idaho Falls Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Longivity of Botox resuts</h4><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_131" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>First, I recommend receiving a neurotoxin such as Botox or Xeomin by a skilled injector. Receiving any injection by an Oculofacial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeon (volume Fillers or Botox) who performs brow lifts, facelifts and neck liposuction, for example, is a master in the effects of Botox on facial musculature.</p><p>There are skilled nurse injectors that are very familiar with ocular and facial composition as well. Second, generally you can expect to feel and see effects of the neurotoxin safely preventing your muscles from contracting and creating “lines” in your face within 2-5 days, reaching full effect between 10 days to 3 weeks.</p><p>Depending on the practitioner’s preference and patient need, any touch-up would occur within this range, but sometimes occur even a month later. In this case, if the patient first had Botox brand, they would likely retouch with Xeomin because our bodies do not created antibodies from repeat treatment with this neurotoxin, but can with repeat Botox over time.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_132" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>They both work great, however! The majority of patients’ results last between 3-4 months, at which time they come back to clinic for routine injections. Sometimes it may take your injector a couple times to get your facial “mapping” maximized for best results.</p><p>Some patients find that they only need to be treated every 6 months, twice a year after years of preventative injections, or based on their biology / metabolism. I even have patients that prefer to come in annually. (Kristin J. Tarbet, MD, FACS, Bellevue Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox last longer with repeated use! </b></p><p>Typically Botox injections can last from 3-4 months. Not surprisingly, your body’s particular characteristics have an impact on the question of how long Botox lasts. To understand this variable you must first understand how Botox works.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_133" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Botox functions by blocking the signals from your nerves to your muscles. With no signal, the muscles relax, in turn causing your wrinkles to soften. Given this, first time users may find Botox last less time as these “virgin” muscles are at their strongest.</p><p>In addition individuals with strong facial muscles may find the effects of Botox wearing off quicker and also needing a larger dose. However, there is good news! I find that consistently using Botox makes each application work better with time.</p><p>This is because the wrinkle-causing muscle gets weaker with each repeated use, allowing the impact of the injections to last longer. (Ana Cristina Laureano, MD, Englewood Dermatologist)</p><h5>Duration of Botox ranges from 3 to 6 months</h5><p>The technique used in Botox treatments can vary greatly between providers. Patients should always be aware of the number of units they are receiving and the areas being treated. The number of units can be given in different concentrations depending the volume of saline used in the dilution.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_134" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-368574394015f1392e64ad20b94a896c">

</div><p>In our practice we use high concentrations to give a maximal, long lasting effect. The typical patient gets 3 to 4 months from the first treatment and 4 to 6 months from subsequent treatments. Learn more:. (Neil J. Zemmel, MD, FACS, Richmond Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Average Botox duration is three to four months, but can be enhanced.</b></p><p>We have found that when we combine fillers with Botox, the effect of both seems to last longer. Usually the botox is used first. After it has settled in, app. 10 days, we will use a filler as needed. (Nathan Mayl, MD (retired), Fort Lauderdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox may last 3-6 months depending on units used and length of use</strong></p><p>Botox may last 3-6 months but for the majority it lasts 3 months for patients who use it for the first time. If less units are used than recommended for a certain area then the results may also not last as long because the muscles return faster.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_135" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>I usually counsel my patients in the use of Botox in the first year for it to be used every 3-4 months so that the muscles can get weaker. If you stick to this regimen then the results can last longer with each treatment and less units are often used.</p><p>The muscles get weaker with time and prevent wrinkles from forming. I have had patients go 9 months between injections and have had Botox for 10+ years. Botox is safe for long-term use. (Kristina Tansavatdi, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox Effects are Individual</b></p><p>The first time someone tries a botulinum toxin for cosmetic wrinkle reduction, it is a learning experience. Most people will find it lasts 3-4 months, some may get six months out of it, and others it may not work(rarely). (Brian Maloney, MD, FACS, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Duration of Botox Effects</h5><p>Botox generally lasts about 3-4 months but sometimes may last a bit longer especially after repeated follow up treatments. First time Botox patients may have musculature that has increased in size before treatment (same way your muscles increase in size with repeated workout at the gym) and therefore may not last as long as musculature that has been treated repeatedly (again same way your muscles remain smaller from repeatedly avoiding the gym).</p><p>Also, doctors who inject greater number of Botox units appropriately may get longer lasting results than providers that use smaller dosages of Botox.
