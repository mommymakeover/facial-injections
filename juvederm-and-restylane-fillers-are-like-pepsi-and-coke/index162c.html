<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Both Restylane and Juvederm are hyaluronic acid fillers made by two competing manufacturers. Restylane was on the market first and hence had an initial “name recognition,” but Juvederm is an equally good product made by a good company (as is Restylane) with some subtle differences.</p><p>These differences, of course are what distinguish each product from its competitor, and these are “played up” by the individual company reps that sell and distribute the products to the physicians who use them (and the public that is the market).</p><p>As far as Juvederm lasting longer, I have looked at the studies, and Juvederm extended the length of time they “looked at” their study patients for still-visible improvements, whereas Restylane stopped their study several months sooner.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2320" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Just because you looked longer doesn’t mean a product actually lasts longer (extra crosslinking or not). But it does give you the ability to tell your reps that Juvederm is still seen in tissue for 9 months or longer, however minimal the residual amounts.</p><p>Lest I sound like I am a Restylane user chafing over the competitor’s advertising and marketing, I should say that I have used both products extensively, and I do see VERY SUBTLE differences that you can read about in some of these answers.</p><p>Juvederm is somewhat “silkier” or smoother to inject, and it lasts at least as long (but probably not any longer, really) as Restylane.</p><p>Perlane and Juvederm Ultra Plus are also comparable. The reality is that your doctor may well choose to use one product over the other not because Pepsi is actually “better” than Coke, but one vendor may choose to sell their product at a slightly better discount in order to obtain market share in a competitive marketplace.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2321" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The differences are THAT MINIMAL! Both products are great, and all HA fillers are a substantial improvement over Collagen products of any kind. (Richard H. Tholen, MD, FACS, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Juvederm vs. Restylane. Kinda like “Coke vs. Pepsi”</strong></p><p>Both are hyaluronic acid substances used for filling in lines and wrinkles. They are both very good at what they do. Restylane is like a gel. Juvederm Ultra is like a syrup. Juvederm Ultra Plus is in-between.</p><p>Having said that, it really depends on the individual patient’s needs, and the doctors personal experience with the substance. I have also found that biochemically sometimes one will last longer in a certain patient vs. the other.</p><p>Again, this is dependent on the individual patient. Always best to get a consultation or two, and then decide what is best for you… (Jeffrey J.

</div><p>Both are Hyaluronic acid gels and they last a similar 6-9 months. I recommend that you find an expert aesthetic, board certified physician whom you trust. At your apt you can discuss your treatment goals and a thorough plan can be devised to achieve them.</p><p>Who you have do your injections is a far more important question than choosing between two similar products. The nice thing is that both of these products have a rewards program associated with them now; Brilliant Distinctions is Allergan’s Reward program, any time you have Botox, Juvederm, Voluma, or purchase Skin Medica skin care products, you get points toward your next treatment with those products.</p><p>Galderma has recently launched Aspire which is a similar rewards program for the products Restylane, Restylane silk, Restylane Lyft and Dysport.

</div><p>Its great to have both lines of products and its even better for the consumer to have different products within each line. This gives us an amazing range of tools to help rejuvenate the face.</p><p>I think that longevity depends on so many factors that it’s hard to say which one lasts longer. There are studies showing superiority of some Juvederm products in some locations. I use use all the products depending on many patient factors especially the facial location and the desired results. (Michael Weinberg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Juvederm and Restylane are hyaluronic acid soft tissue fillers and are both excellent products. There are subtle differences and in our practice we usually see great results with both lines of fillers. (Anatoli Freiman, MD, Toronto Dermatologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2324" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p><b>Lip Enhancement with Juvederm and Restylane</b></p><p>Galderma provides a family of fillers called Restylane. Both Restylane Silk and Restylane-L are both FDA-approved for lip enhancement. These hyaluronic acid fillers gently correct vertical lip lines as well ! Allergan provides Juvederm Ultra and Ultra Plus– both of which are also FDA -approved for use in the lips.</p><p>An expert injector can assist in making the best choice for your desired outcome!(Larry S. Nichter, MD, MS, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Both are great products and I use them both in my practice. The number one consideration I would recommend is the skill and experience of the injector. I am an official trainer for both the makers of Restylane and Juvederm and know that thee is a wide spread of comfort, experience and skill in injections. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2325" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I’ve been injecting Juvederm and Restylane and for as long as they’ve been FDA approved. They are very similar. Both are Hyaluronic acid. Both work really well. I think it can be up to the injector, or the patient on occasion, which they prefer in particular areas.</p><p>They both last 6 to 12 months in my opinion, occasionally longer. (Rebecca Baxt, MD, Paramus Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>We have been using both products in our office and find they have very similar profiles. The main difference is that Juvederm expands more and provides better plumping and volumizing. Restylane, on the other hand, is a little more firm and provides better outline of the lip and creates a sharper looking lip rim.</p><p>So, I think what matters is what the patient is trying to achieve whether or not you use Juvederm or Restylane. (Juan A. Brou, MD, Oklahoma City Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2326" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-34995e66c422e6d315276f7e9f6196f4">

</div><p><b>Injector is more important than the product</b></p><p>Juvederm and Restylane are both great products. I use both of them regularly in my practice. Each has an advantage and a very mild disadvantage compared to each other, but I can’t say that I’ve noticed that one lasts longer than the other.</p><p>The more important thing is WHO is injecting these products. You want to make sure that your injector has a tremendous amount of experience, and ideally, if they are not a physician, that they are closely overseen by a physician that is a specialist of the face. (Andrew Campbell, MD, Milwaukee Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Both are FDA approved hyaluronic acid fillers and can be used on various areas of the face. Your board-certified specialist will decide which is best for you depending on the area being treated and the effect desired. (Ava Shamban, MD, Santa Monica Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2327" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I used Restylane before Juvederm was introduced. When Juvederm became available, I switched because the material hurts less when it is injected, it has a better viscosity for injection control, the results look nicer, and the material lasts longer.</p><p>Now there is Juvederm with powdered lidocaine so the injection is even less painful. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>There Is No “Best” Filler</h5><p>I hesitate to call one filler “better” than another. JUVÉDERM and Restylane are both hyaluronic acid-based fillers, which makes them quite safe to use on most people.</p><p>They’re formulated in different ways, so their consistencies are slightly different. Their longevities are estimations based on typical use, but each timeline can vary somewhat depending on where the product was injected and your own physiology.</p><p>Injecting fillers requires a certain degree of artistry and experience with the way each product distributes and settles. Although doctors often have their own preferred fillers for certain areas of the face, there are seldom any constant rules.</p><p>Rather than getting bogged down in the technical details of each product, you might get better results by choosing an injector who is experienced with several products. Read testimonials and look at before-and-after pictures first.</p><p>During your consultation, you can discuss which product or combination of products may be best for you. (Howard Silverman, MD, FRCSC, Ottawa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I do prefer Juvederm rather than Restylane, some reasons are patient and doctor support from Juvederm is better, the other reason is that I think that Juvederm has a nice selection of products from Volbella to Voluma.</p><p>Voluma does last upto 18 months, and is super easy to administer with a proven safety record. The much can be said for Restylane as well. (Davin Lim, MBBS, FACD, Brisbane Dermatologist)</p><p>Juvederm and Restylaneare both hyaluronic acid fillers that have similar longevity. There are subtle differences in their properties which an injector may prefer for different areas. Find an experienced injector who understands the subtle difference of these products.
