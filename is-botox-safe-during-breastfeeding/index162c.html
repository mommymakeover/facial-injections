<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h5>Botox Not for Pregnant or Breastfeeding</h5><p>While Botox is, when used properly, extremely safe, it should never be used in pregnant women or those who are breastfeeding. If you are not breastfeeding, or have completed nursing, then you are fine to receive your Botox treatments. (Jeffrey C. Poole, MD, Metairie Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>BOTOX is safe very soon after pregnancy, presuming that you are not nursing. BOTOX has not been studied in pregnancy nor during nursing, so better safe than sorry; I’d wait till after nursing, or 1 week after delivery. (Benjamin Barankin, MD, FRCPC, Toronto Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>As long as you are not breastfeeding you can safely have Botox injected anytime after the pregnancy.</p><p>If you are breastfeeding, you should wait until you are no longer breastfeeding before having Botox injected. (Harold J. Kaplan, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3326" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b21d954b140adb9454616895c4a5225f">

</div><p><i>Botox safe one month after pregnancy if not breast feeding.</i></p><p>If you are not breast feeding, you can really have Botox injections most anytime after your baby is born. Or a couple of weeks after you stop breast feeding. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Waiting to get Botox after pregnancy</h4><p>Botox binds to the muscle receptors IMMEDIATELY after injection. It does not travel an appreciable distance from the site of injection in the vast majority of patients BUT we live in a country OF Lawyers, run BY lawyers, FOR lawyers.</p><p>As such since Botox was not studied in pregnant or lactating women the use of Botox in such women is not recommended. You would not want to send a lawyer’s kid through a year of college would you? (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3327" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Botox has not been clinically studied on pregnant women, women who want to become pregnant or women who are breast-feeding. If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant it is not known if Botox can harm your unborn child.</p><p>If you are breast-feeding or plan to breastfeed it is not known if Botox passes into the breast milk. You can get Botox injected immediately after pregnancy if you are not breastfeeding. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox or Dysport not to be injected until breastfeeding ends</h4><p>Because of exceedingly rare reports of distant migration of botulinum injections, one should hold off Botox or Dysport injection until breastfeeding ends. It is not certain whether or not botulinum toxin may be passed through breastmilk, and thus there is a theoretical risk of muscle paralysis of infant affecting breathing, etc though none has been reported to my knowledge. (William Ting, MD, Bay Area Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3328" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><h3>Botox and post-pregnancy</h3><p>Obviously, you should not be breast feeding at the time even though there are no studies suggesting Botox transfer through the breast milk. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Getting Botox after pregnancy and delivery</strong></p><p>There are no studies about Botox treatments and pregnancy or breastfeeding, but the long history of Botox use and the many studies that have been done over the years indicate that it is safe to get your treatments as soon as you feel up to it after you deliver your child, or once you finish breastfeeding. (Jordana S. Gilman, MD, Washington Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Wait to stop breastfeeding before receiving Botox</b></p><p>It is best to wait until after you have stopped breast-feeding before receiving Botox. This is an added precaution but will give you more time to focus on your beautiful new baby. For more information on Botox or to schedule an iConsult, please visit us online at:. (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3329" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h4>There’s no clinical data on treating nursing mothers with Botox</h4><p>Since there are no clinical studies on doing elective cosmetic Botox treatment for a nursing or pregnant mother, there is no data to support its safety but also no data to prove it unsafe. Many women have safely had Botox injections who didn’t know they were pregnant and there are not documented problems.</p><p>However, it is prudent to avoid unnecessary treatments while pregnant or nursing. (Margaret Weiss, MD, Baltimore Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>I would certainly not use any botox while you are breast feeding. There is more than enough time once you have finished to use either botox or dysport – a new botulinum toxin.</p><p>Enjoy the baby then worry about the botox! (Steven Schuster, MD, FACS, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3330" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a86fe13a97262f852bdd92c8b935f613">

</div><h4>Timing of Botox after Pregnancy</h4><p>Once you have delivered and are not breast-feeding, you can get the injections. The concern during pregnancy is if any toxin can be transmitted through the placenta and after delivery–throught the breast milk. (Armando Soto, MD, FACS, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox After Pregnancy</h5><p>If you are breast feeding, you should not use Botox, as it could theoretically pass to your baby. If you are not breast feeding, you are a candidate for Botox, as long as you have no other contraindications, such as allergy or neuromuscular disease such as MS. (Karen Vaniver, MD, Kennewick Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Your baby may make that little scrunchy line between the eyebrows, but we don’t treat babies with BOTOX. For the same reason, resuming BOTOX treatment is not recommended until your baby is fully weaned.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3331" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-992609270e15a3489b1d710341d52188">

</div><p>At this point, it is safe for you to have BOTOX. When you are ready to conceive again, it is recommended you consult with your gynecologist regarding cessation of BOTOX treatment. Although there is no evidence that it interferes with conception or causes birth defects, it is only prudent to stop treatment well before attempting to become pregnant again. (Kenneth D. Steinsapir, MD, Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox after pregnancy and breast feeding</h3><p>After pregnancy, wait until you are done breast feeding before having any Botox injections. Once you are completely done breast-feeding and not pregnant, then you can resume Botox treatments. (Anita Patel, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Avoid Botox When Pregnant or Breast Feeding</h5><p>Botox should not be given to women who are pregnant or breast feeding. As soon as you finish breast feeding, you can have your lines treated with Botox. (Joshua Zeichner, MD, Manhattan Dermatologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3332" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Avoid Botox During Pregnancy and When Breast-feeding</h3><p>Botox should be avoided during pregnancy and when breast-feeding. Therefore, as long as you are not breast-feeding, botox post-pregnancy is fine. Enjoy the new addition to your life (the baby)! (Channing R. Barnett, MD, Boca Raton Dermatologist)</p><h4>Botox After Pregnancy</h4><p>As long as you are not breast feeding, and assuming you have cleared it with your Ob/Gyn, use of Botox is permissible and safe very soon after pregnancy. A well deserved present after 9 months of work! (Stephen Prendiville, MD, Fort Myers Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You may resume the use of Botox Cosmetic immediately after pregnancy, assuming you are not breast feeding. (Glenn Vallecillos, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most non-essential medications should not be taken while breast feeding over fear that they could be passed to the baby. Since Botox is a purely elective treatment, you should wait until you are done breast feeding. (Randy J. Buckspan, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>No Botox while breast feeding</h3><p>I do not recommend Botox until after you are done breast feeding at this point in time. (Deason Dunagan, MD, Huntsville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>No Botox during pregnancy and breast feeding</h5><p>Botox is not approved during pregnancy but can be injected immediately after. And if you intend to breastfeed, you need to wait until you are finished. (Bruce E. Katz, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is not indicated during pregnancy but may be injected immediately after pregnancy if you are not breast feeding or can be injected once you have finished breastfeeding. (Elizabeth F. Rostan, MD, Charlotte Dermatologist)</p><h5>No botox during pregnancy or breast feeding</h5><p>I would suggest that Botox not be administered to pregnant women or women that are breast feeding. The patient should be encouraged to wait until these periods of time are completely resolved. (Steven Hacker, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p></div>
