<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Botox is a safe FDA approved treatment for static wrinkles that can be started even in the 20’s as a great preventative treatment to avoid permanently etched facial wrinkles in the future. (Bryan Criswell, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Age is not a factor for Botox. Starting Botox injections in your 20’s and 30’s can actually have preventative benefits and help the lines from becoming deeper and etched. (Leonard Lu, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox OK in Your 20’s</i></p><p>There are no dangers to starting Botox in your 20’s. The ideal time to start is not age related, rather when you begin to notice static expression lines on the forehead, glabella and crow’s feet.</p><p>Starting Botox when you begin to notice these lines as will make treatment over time easier and more effective as opposed to waiting and then trying to reverse deep lines. I would advise a consultation with a board-certified dermatologist to discuss what is right for you and your goals. (Dennis Gross, MD, New York Dermatologist)<br>

</div><h5>Botox: starting early </h5><p>Botox (like Xeomin and Dysport) is a medication injected into target muscles of the face to selectively weaken them for fewer/softer wrinkles. </p><p>Although static rhytids (wrinkles at rest) can be softened, theses injections dramatically help dynamic rhytids (wrinkles when you move your face).</p><p> Starting Botox in your 20s can prevent wrinkles before they form. There are no reported cases of patients having any problems from using the medication long term. I use a lower dose when injecting the forehead as there is potential to create a heavy brow.</p><p>A perfectly smooth forehead sitting low on your brows can make you appear more tired and older than someone who has a few lines on a supported brow. Safety comes first. (Victor Chung, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<strong>Botox for Younger Patients</strong><p>I have injected many patients in their 20s for static and dynamic wrinkles and patients have been very pleased. The thought behind beginning injections earlier is that it may prevent excess facial movement, decreasing the prevalence and severity of “dynamic wrinkles” with aging. (Sammy Sinno, MD, Chicago Physician)</p><p><em>NOT too young for Botox</em></p><p>There are no dangers with starting Botox at age 20. The great thing about starting early is that it can prevent you from getting deeper lines in the future. If your lines are static, Botox is a great option to soften them but may not completely remove them, it really depends on the depth of your lines. I recommend you consult with a well-trained and experienced provider to be certain that Botox is the best treatment option for you.<br>

</div>If you have deep lines, you may need Botox and a resurfacing procedure or filler. I recommend following with a board certified dermatologist or Cosmetic/Plastic surgeon to discuss treatment/expectations. (Kenne Ogunmakin, MD, Katy Dermatologic Surgeon)
<p>if you start seeing lines remain on your skin after smiling and laughing is time to make them disappear! If you start early you’ll need few rounds and maybe once or twice a year will be enough. (Onir Spiegel, DDS, PhD, Boston Dentist)</p><p><em>Botox</em></p><p>There should not be associated risks with starting Botox at age 20. Botox works best on dynamic wrinkles (wrinkles with movement) and will soften wrinkles at rest. The typical areas of injection for someone your age would include the upper forehead and glabellar complex (the central area between the brows extending to the mid-brows).<br>

</div>Results typically last for 3-4 months. It is important to make sure you are going to a board certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon to ensure you are getting injected in the correct areas and they are using genuine product.
<p>Starting at a younger age will actually prevent the muscles from over-activity and prevent future wrinkling / worsening of existing wrinkles. (Kevin Cavanaugh, MD, Chicago Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>How soon is too soon to start Botox?</strong></p><p>Actually we are seeing more and more young patients (20’s-30’s) wanting to start using Botox to prevent wrinkles and maintain the youthful appearance. As you may well know Botox is not permanent and will require ongoing usage typically every 3-4 months and for some up to six months depending on the age and desired result.<br>

</div>It is very safe, FDA approved and no evidence to date to support the notion of negative long term affects. Don’t forget to take care of your skin along the way at the very least using sunblock! Be well and enjoy. (Paul Pietro, MD, Greenville Physician)
<p><strong>Static forehead lines</strong></p><p>Botox treats dynamic lines, not static lines. If they are truly static and deep a filler may be more appropriate but there are no long term side effect from starting Botox early. Be sure you see a board certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon. (Melvin Elson, MD, Nashville Dermatologist)</p><h3>Botox – how early can you start?</h3><p>Botox can be used in your 20’s as long as there is a clinical indication and benefit, This can provide a preventive effect for younger patients concerned about deep wrinkles and creases later in life.<br>

</div>I have been injecting Botox for myself since I was 27 and now 18 years later I am glad I started young (BTW I have not seen any negative side effects). (John Tang, MD, Los Gatos Physician)
<p><b>Concern for commencing Botox treatment at 20 years of age</b></p><p>Provided there are no medical contraindications for neuromodular injection treatment such as history of autoimmune or neuromuscular disease, then your age at 20 is not a direct contraindication for treatment alone. Such anti-wrinkle injections are in fact very effective in both directly treating existing static forehead lines and also help prevent deepening forehead wrinkles from emerging in the future.</p><p>I would recommend that you consult with an experienced and highly trained practitioner to ensure your safety and achieve optimal results.

<p><em>Botox Results with Younger Patients</em></p><p>I often recommend my younger patients begin preventative treatments, including botox. Results will last 3-4 months. I recommend getting a formal evaluation with a cosmetic dermatologist. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox at the age of 20</h3><p>There are no dangers or downsides to starting Botox at your age of 20. It is actually a preventative for when you start to age you will not notice the wrinkles as much later on, but you will need to continue the Botox process.</p><p>Botox is completely safe when following the correct guidelines and procedures. (Homan Siman, MD, Encino Physician)</p><h5>Are There Any Downsides And Or Dangers To Beginning Botox Treatment At The Age Of 20?</h5><p> As long as you have an indication for treatment, i.e., static creases present, now would be a good time to start Botox.  Natural results can be achieved.  Botox is an extremely safe and effective FDA-approved treatment for facial wrinkles.</p><p> There were millions of Botox procedures performed in the US last year and that number is rapidly increasing.  Please be sure to see an expert injector for an in-person consultation to fully discuss your goals and expectations in order to determine the best treatment plan. (Christian N. Ford, M.D., Boston Physician)</p><p><i>Botox or Baby Botox </i></p><p>There It is a common myth that one can start botox treatment too young. I don’t think that the age is the issue but the state of the skin. If the forehead has static lines by 20 then they will only get worse and the best treatment is botox.</p><p>The reason they are there is that the muscle is so active that the skin has effectively become damaged. The botox stops the skin moving and gives the skin a chance to heal. What I do have an issue with (and makes me very angry) is the treatment encouraged by disreputable and disgraceful individuals of injecting botox in to patients where there no wrinkles to prevent them coming.</p><p>Once the muscle has been weakened and you have got out of the habit you can always reduce frequency of injections but to get initial control of your severely overactive muscles is going to be a challenge. (Dinesh Maini, MBChB, London Physician)</p><h3>When to begin Botox</h3><p>We often treat patients in their 20s who are concerned with current wrinkles or who are hoping to prevent wrinkles from forming in the future. Wrinkles can present at varying ages due to genetics, muscle strength and health of the overlying skin.</p><p>In someone who already has wrinkles, Botox will help to prevent these from becoming worse and can soften the wrinkles over time. The muscles affected by Botox injections, are only those where the Botox is injected.</p><p>Since Botox relaxes the underlying muscle, it can over time weaken, which can result in needing less Botox in the future and be less likely to cause wrinkling of the overlying skin. This effect is also preventative since the overlying skin isn’t allowed to wrinkle.</p><p>If you do choose to begin Botox, please be sure to research and visit a provider who has proper training and experience!
