<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>For most patients, Botox lasts 3-4 months. However, a small percentage of patients get a shorter (2 months), or longer (6 months) duration. The longevity is affected by the injection technique, the date & technique the Botox was mixed, the number of units injected, and many other factors. (Peter N. Butler, MD, FACS, Pensacola Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox duration vaires with the dose, your gender & how you use your muscles</h5><p>Botox usually lasts 3-4 months and it is unlikely that a longer-acting agent will be available soon. How long Botox lasts can be affected by many factors: More Botox generally lasts longer. (In the frown area, 30 units will last longer than 10 units).</p><p>The optimal dose is one which totally relaxes the muscle. Males, who have strong facial muscles, need more Botox than females. More animated faces need more Botox than the ‘poker face’ person. Other tips: To keep from squinting, use sunglasses, increase the type face size on your computer, and minimize glare on your screens.

</div><p>Botox or Dysport lasts about 3-4 months. The amount of product injected largely determines the duration. In some cases, people get injections with product that is diluted too much or they get only half of the normal dose (usually for 2/3 the normal price).</p><p>This is usually the cause for Botox or Dysport that does not last this long. One other reason that people dont get typical longevity is that these products are dosed on muscle mass and for people that are very muscular or that are working out a lot, they may need above average doses or require more frequent doses.</p><p>If you are planning to train for a triathalon, mention it to your doctor and he or she can adjust your dose.

</div><p>Botox is used cosmetically to soften muscle motion and thus selectively reduce dynamic facial wrinkling. Typical longevity for Botox used in this regard is 3-4 months. Some patients may experience effects of Botox beyond 4 months, while others, such as male patients may require retreatment after 2-3 months.</p><p>Botox takes approximately 14 days to take full effect following initial injection. Working with a skilled injector is important when receiving a Botox treatment as knowledge of anatomy and experience with appropriate dosing is imperative for a natural, consistent beautiful outcome. (Bradley Bengtson, MD, FACS, Grand Rapids Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox Longevity Varies by Person</i></p><p>Botox typically lasts 3-4 months, however sometimes athletes or people with very high metabolisms will break down the Botox more quickly than other people. There are lasers that you can do to improve the health and quality of the skin to have the effects last longer as well. (Richard E. Neils, MD, Madison Dermatologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_75" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The average duration for Botox treatment to last is around 4 months, but this can be influenced by a number of factors. I have found that people who take care of their skin and protect it from UV radiation can get a better result for longer, owing to the fact that the skin will be less damaged over time.</p><p>Factors that reduce the longevity of Botox treatment include sun exposure, heavy exercise and smoking. (Mary Jane (MJ) Rowland-Warmann, BDS, MSc, Liverpool Dentist)</p><p>The longevity of Botox, Dysport, or Xeomin is different from person to person. Typically Botox lasts about 3-6 months. There are many different reasons why Botox can last longer for on person and not another.</p><p>It is always important to have an experienced, board certified physican, performing your Botox injections. If to little Units are used per area, it can lead to a short term effect. Age, genetics, and the muscle pull are also other reasons Botox may not last as long for a patient.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_76" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>When Botox, and other toxins are injected correctly, they should have a lasting effect of 3 months minimally, but an average of 4 months. (Stephen T. Greenberg, MD, Woodbury Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The longevity of Botox will vary from patient to patient. You should always start with a consultation before any injection to address any concerns or questions you may have.</p><p>We tell clients the good news is if you don’t like it Botox generally lasts 3-6 months and will wear off gradually and the bad news is if you love it Botox generally lasts 3-6 months and will wear off gradually. (Charles McKaraher, MD, Hickory Family Physician)</p><p>Botox usually last 3-4 months in the majority of patients assuming the patients received an adequate dose, the Botox was placed into the appropriate muscle, and genuine Botox Cosmetic was used. That being said, Botox can last longer in some patients and shorter in other.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_77" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d87d550619663a1157fa2e6f7e0b1eb5">

</div><p>Patients who are very active such as those training for a marathon may see shortened longevity. (Shaun Patel, MD, Miami Physician)</p><p>Botox usually last three months, but depending on the individual that average can be as short as two months or as long as six months. I tell my patients that they should expect to see three months out of each treatment. (Kelly DiStefano, MD, Verona Physician)</p><p>Botox in most of my patients lasts 8-9 months. However, I use the highest concentration allowed by FDA. Many doctors dilute Botox to the maximum lowest concentration allowed. This is especially true when you see Botox “on sale’ or advertised in a “groupon”.</p><p>I recently had a client come in 9 months after her previous Botox injections. She tried to bargain me down to what my competitor was offering for Botox. She admitted that my Botox lasted at least twice as long.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_78" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I offered to match the competitors price if she would allow me to ‘water-down’ the Botox as he does or she could go back to him. She told me, “No thanks, you’re worth it… you do a better job”.</p><p>She let me do her treatment and I’ll see her in 9 months! Some people do metabolize Botox more rapidly than others.</p><p>Some people rarely develop antibodies to Botox and it does not last them very long. (LeRoy Yates, MD, FACOG, Davenport OB-GYN)</p><p><i>Botox can last longer when treated regularly</i></p><p>The simple answer to how long Botox lasts is 3-4 months for most patients initially. However, it is not uncommon for me to see patients whose results last 5-6 months (or even longer). Why are they so lucky? Well, the more in-depth answer is a little more involved–but is worth understanding.</p><p>The longevity of your Botox result actually depends on several different factors. The most important ones to focus on, in my opinion, are:</p><p><strong>1) How strong the treated muscles are (how deep are your lines)</strong></p><p>The stronger the muscles that we are trying to treat with Botox, the greater the likelihood that the effects of Botox will wear off by 3 months, or even a little bit sooner–at least initially.</p><p><strong>2) How much Botox is being used</strong></p><p>The stronger the muscle is that creates the unwanted lines and wrinkles, the greater the amount of Botox required to effectively relax the hyperactive muscle.</p><p>If you don’t use enough, the results will fall short of the 3 month period.</p><p>Of course, the experienced physician knows how to balance putting more Botox in with ensuring a natural-looking result.</p><p><strong>3) How long you have been treated with Botox</strong></p><p>Many patients who have been treated with Botox regularly (every 3-4 months) for several years, will often find that their results begin to last beyond the 3-4 month range.</p><p>It is not uncommon for me to have patients who now only have to come in every 6-7 months to maintain their results.</p><p>I think that this happens, because over time even the strongest, overactive muscles will weaken with persistent relaxation from Botox.</p><p>If you don’t work out the muscle, it is going to weaken (just like any other muscle in the body). Like a fine wine, Botox treatment longevity can get even better with time! (Haresh Yalamanchili, MD, Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
