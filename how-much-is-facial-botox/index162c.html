<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>There is incredible variability in the price of facial BOTOX Cosmetic among medical clinics, spas, etc., within the same cities and states and who is doing the injecting. In my opinion the most cost effective way to purchase BOTOX Cosmetic for patients is to purchase by the UNIT. If you are younger and have less noticeable lines than say an individual who is in their 60’s you should require less units. Why pay by the “area” you may need less than the amount that is being charged.</p><p>The common denomimators for determining what works best for you are the number of “UNITS” required to achieve the desired result and the experience of the injector who understands your goals and recognizes potential undesireable outcomes from placing BOTOX Cosmetic in areas that may result in the opposite effect you are looking for.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1742" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Price range usually $8-$17/UNIT. (Christopher Tolan, MD, Saint Paul Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The actual cost of facial Botox is approximately $6 per unit to the physician’s office.</p><p>Each physician charges a fee for the injection and placement of the Botox.</p><p>The total cost will be the amount of units and the injection fee.</p><p>The fee can vary from $10 to 20 per unit based on the following factors:</p><p>Dilution- Every office will use a different amount of saline with facial Botox. Diluting Botox too much, can lead to less control while using Botox in a more concentrated version often requires more technical skill in placing the Botox in the intended location. </p><p>In my opinion, there is an optimal dilution for Botox for each application to achieve the best aesthetic result.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1743" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Knowledge of Facial Anatomy- Not all injectors are the same. An injector who does not tailor their technique for an individual’s unique facial anatomy will often lead to less desirable outcomes.</p><p>Injector Skill- There is technical expertise in Botox. Botox should rarely cause bruising when administered properly and be relatively pain free.</p><p>Application- Botox can be used in a variety of applications. It can even be used to reduce facial shine and acne (I have attached a link to the first paper I authored which describes this). (Anil R. Shah, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>How much does Botox cost?</h4><p>Facial Botox is not cheap, but it is one of the most highly recommended cosmetic procedures because it works very well. You can find Botox injections as cheap as $10 per unit in Missouri which would be injected by an “injector”.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1744" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>Non-physicians can be excellent injectors, but a thorough understanding of facial anatomy and musculature separates artistic results associated with excellent injectors from the entrepreneurs who have been trained by the sales representative. We charge $11 per unit for Botox.</p><p>It’s an incredible deal to get Botox at this pricing for a staff who really knows facial muscle anatomy and gets you the most natural look without overtreating. You will know if it is worth the risk for you. (Michael H. Swann, MD, Springfield Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Obviosly the cost depends on the quantity used. Prices vary throughout the country. In general the treatment is $300-$400 per area; ie, the area between the brows, the laugh lines, or the forehead. If the price seem too good, it probably is. There is bogus material out there. Make sure you see a physician who gets the Botox from Allergan Corporation. (Richard W. Fleming, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1745" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><em>Botox cost</em></p><p>Botox can be charged either per zone ($350-1000), or per unit injected ($8 – 20). Usually 20 to 30 units are injected per zone. A zone is usually defined as one anatomic area, such as the forehead, area between the eyebrows, or outer eye area.</p><p>You should be cautious about going to someone who is too cheap (you usually get what you pay for) — if the price is too cheap, this may indicate that the Botox being used was obtained from a source other than Allergan, such as a foreign supplier where there is no assurance that you are getting the real product; or that the injector is inexperienced and is trying to low-ball the competition.</p><p>Go to someone who is experienced both in the use of Botox, has a good knowledge of facial anatomy, and who knows how to treat potential complications. </p><p>You may find the Allergan web site useful where providers are listed. (Wilfred Brown, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1746" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-06a1a06cc8830174602f4e0e25999fef">

</div><p>Dach unit of botox costs the practicioner $5. Thus, if you use 30 u of botox, our cost is $150. (Christopher K. Livingston, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The range of facial Botox prices in Mpls/St Paul is $10-18/unit. We offer a new patient price for $10/unit with a coupon on our website. Here is what you need to know however. The price of Botox is not as important as the person injecting.</p><p>It is unfortunately very easy to ‘cheat’ by diluting the Botox with a little extra saline. Increasingly, we are seeing patients from other practices that mysteriously aren’t getting as good a result with the same number of units as they did in the past.</p><p>Although impossible to prove, it suggests some fudging by the injector. We not only give our patients a great price, but guarantee the result. For our new patients, we have them return at 2 weeks to make sure that we have obtained the desired results and they are happy.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1747" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If there’s a problem, we fix it for free. The bottom line: make sure that the place that you get your Botox not only gives you a great price but that they back up their work. (Joseph Campanelli, MD, Portland Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox varies in cost depending on the number of units used ans the areas injected. You should ask you physician before you get injected so as to avoid sticker shock! (Carlos Wolf, MD, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox cost can range depending on the expertise of the physician and location of the practice. In my opinion botox requires meticulous skill to maintain the natural apperance of the person and to keep somoene looking natural.</p><p>I wouldnt compromise your care for cost or distance. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1748" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Some practices charge by the area and some by the number of units. We charge by the number of units, this not only gives patients the flexibility from a cost persective but also will allow me to treat the patient with the appropriate amount of botox for each area which will depend on the severity of the lines.</p><p>A patient with less lines on the forehead, may only need 16 units, where as a patient that has deeper and more significate lines, may need 40 units. We charge $12.00 a unit and I personally do all injectables myself. (Patricia Yugueros, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Every patient is different and treatment should be individualized. In general, a treatment for these areas in my practice ranges from $275 – $550. </p><p>I would certainly advise the least amount for the most natural result. You could always do more. (George C. Peck, Jr, MD, West Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It depends on how many areas are treated and the geographic location. Some doctors charge by area and some charge according to the number of units are injected. Usually range is $10-$17 a unit. (Tal T. Roudner, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>India BOTOX prices</h5><p>I use BOTOX Cosmetic from Allergan. The charge per unit works out to around $7, and I inject all my patients myself. The prices may not be comparable to those at where you stay, though! (Renita (Lourdhurajan) Rajan, MD, DNB, India Dermatologist)</p><p>Facial Botox comes in 2 vial sizes, 50 and 100 units. It is clearly marked on the bottle that it is for single patient use, so bottles are not to be shared for fear of cross contamination of disease.</p><p></p>

</div>For that reason, you would need to buy a full vial for yourself, but different doctors price it differently. I strongly urge you to only use an injector that sells you the entire vial in order to avoid potential transmission of hepatitis or other diseases. (Julio Garcia, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Facial Botox cost does vary. We charge $14.00 dollar/unit. The areas typically consist of the forehead, the lines in-between the brows, and crow’s feet. On average our patients receive between 16 and 40 units for the desired results.</p><p>Be careful when price shopping for Botox. Make sure that you find someone who is skilled and preferably a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon. (Robert Heck, MD, FACS, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I believe the best person to determine your optimal result from botox is me, I find that when people pay by the unit or area they tend to sacrifice one area over another leading to a suboptimal result.</p><p>that’s why I charge a flat rate for the treatment no matter how much I use, typically about 40-60 units but can be as little as 25u if that’s all that’s needed.</p><p>It seems to me you are paying me for a result not the actual botox, that’s just the tool I’m using. short answer is 700USD.
