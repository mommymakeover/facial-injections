<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Botox can be injected under the eye but must be done with care and caution. The muscle that you target is the orbicularis oculi which helps to open and close the eye.</p><p>You never want to fully paralyze this muscle so directly under the eye- only small baby doses should be used if at all because you don’t want to deal with secondary lower lid malposition or other potential complications.</p><p>The crinkles are from muscle contraction so botox can help soften this. Any permanent crinkles/ fine lines or wrinkles can be treated with laser resurfacing or a strong TCA peel to help smooth out the undereye contour.</p><p>Oftentimes, small amounts of botox are done simultaneously to help keep area smoother.

</div><p>Yes, a small amount of Botox (1-2 units) can be injected under the eyes in the appropriate patient to soften dynamic wrinkles related to muscle activity. A “snap back test” should first be performed by the injector to determine the strength of the orbicularis oculi muscle.</p><p>If the muscle is weakened, which can be the case in older patients, then it is advisable to avoid the Botox injection.</p><p>When injecting the under eye with Botox it is also recommended that the crow’s feet be injected as well. (Shaun Patel, MD, Miami Physician)</p><p>It is possible to use a muscle relaxant such as Botox underneath the eye to soften fine lines and make the eye slightly wider (1-3mm) when smiling – for this reason it is a common treatment in some Asian countries.</p><p>This treatment, however, requires very careful patient selection – treating the wrong person in this area can worsen bags under the eyes and cause eye-related symptoms. When considering this treatment be sure to consult a physician who is experienced in this area. (Scott Ellis, MBBS, Adelaide Physician)</p><p><em>Botox can be injected for under eye wrinkles</em></p><p>Botox can be injected for under eye wrinkles ( off label advanced use of Botox). These under eye wrinkles should be dynamic or worsened with smiling. I do this treatment often and am comfortable with offering it to those who would benefit from it.</p><p>It is best if done along with the sides of the eyes or crow’s feet region and not alone. The key with under eye Botox treatment is finding a physician who is comfortable and experienced with this type of treatment.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1769" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

The key is very small quantities of Botox to relax the muscle but not over weaken it, which would cause sagging of the lid margin.</p><p>Also, this muscle helps support the top of the cheek and in those prone to lower eyelid bags, this weakening can worsen the bag… again small quantities does the trick!.

</div></center><h4>Under eye botox</h4><p>It is indeed possible to have Botox injections under the eyes in select patients, in fact most patients. I would only treat this area with crows feet injections, not I usually avoid under eye treatments if the patient has bags under the eyes or poor skin tone/support in that area.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1770" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Dosages between 1-2 units per site. It’s always better to be cautious in this area. (Stephen Giordano, DO, Huntersville Physician)</p><p><strong>Botox can be used sparingly under the eye</strong></p><p>Botox is used under the eye for many reasons: pre-tarsal “jelly roll,” small wrinkles around the eye area, etc. Units are used very sparingly and injections are very superficial. (Sameer Bashey, MD, Beverly Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Under eye area needs more than Botox</i></p><p>Botox 1 to 2 units can help under eye crease as long as there is adequate skin “snap”. Most people need a multipronged approach. This can involve:</p><ol>
<li>Botulinum toxin small dose to relax the muscle under the eye.</li>
<li>“Bunny line” nose relaxation with botulinum toxin as these nose muscles pull under the eye as well.</li>
<li>PRP (eg Selphyl) to build collagen.</li>
<li>Skin tightening with radiofrequency (eg Thermage).</li>
<li>Dermal filler to support the hollow teartrough area, preferably a soft hyaluronic acid such as Belotero Soft or Juvederm Volbella, via canula for safety and precision. (Gidon Frame, MD, Vancouver Physician)</li>
</ol><p>I use under eye Botox very frequently and have for years. Location and dose are very important knowledge that expert injectors will be aware of. Find one. (Maurice M. Vick, Jr., MD, Baton Rouge Urologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1771" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Botox can be injected under the eye. In younger population Botox can be injected in particular area to increase the aperture of eye. Botox can also be use in “micro” doses along the lower eyelid just to slightly weaken that part of the muscle.</p><p>However, to maintain uniform results, small doses may be required in part of the “crow’s feet”. On average, I would use in all those injection points no more than 2-3 units. (Marek Kacki, MD, Nashville Internist)</p><p>You can indeed put small amounts of Botox under the eyelid to smooth the lower lid. Seek out a plastic surgeon or dermatologist who is skilled in this application. (Kenneth R. Francis, MD, FACS, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Under eye-great place for very small quantities of BOTOX</h5><p>Generally, when a doctor tells you that something can’t be done, it means that it has not been successful in their hands. My father liked to say: “If the butcher tells you the meat’s bad, you should listen.”</p><p>The key with under eye Botox treatment is finding a clinician who is comfortable and experienced with this type of treatment. Don’t make your doctor do a treatment they have told you they don’t do well.</p><p>The lower eyelid orbicularis muscle makes those crinkling lines. This muscle is also responsible for holding the lower eyelid against the eye. The key is very small quantities of Botox to relax the muscle but not over weaken it, which causes sagging of the lid margin (not a good thing).</p><p>Also, the orbicularis muscle helps support the top of the cheek and in certain individuals prone to lower eyelid bags, this weakening can worsen the bag-also not a good thing. For many individuals, they are better off having the lower eyelid filled with Restylane to redistribute the lower eyelid wrinkles. (Kenneth D. Steinsapir, MD, Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)<br>

Many people have these wrinkles that occur when the muscle called the orbicularis oculi contracts with laughing or smiling, and when they become noticeable or aesthetically bothersome, tiny amounts of Botox can be injected into the parts of the muscle of the lower lid that is hyperkinetic (or moving a lot to cause the wrinkles).</p><p>I would recommend speaking to a dermatologist or plastic surgeon who has a great deal of experience with Botox injections for this procedure, as it shouldn’t be overdone or you may get problems with forceful shutting of the eyelids and other problems related to the muscle.</p><p>Fraxel would be OK for fine superficial skin wrinkles that are present whether or not you are smiling or laughing.

Such treatment can be useful in younger individuals. Botox injections in this area can cause problems for older individuals, those who have undergone surgery beneath the eye, those with a large amount of redundant skin beneath the eye and individuals with a history of dry eyes (can make it worse).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1768" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>For individuals who are good candidates for injection under the eyes, I usually limit the dose to 2-3 units per side. (Bryan K. Chen, MD, San Diego Dermatologist)</p><h3>Botox can help smile lines but should be used with caution under the eyes</h3><p>The crows feet and smile lines in the cheek are effectively treated with Botox, but one has to be careful when in comes to under-eye wrinkles.</p><p>Muscle tone in this area is critically important to supporting the lower eyelid.</p><p>I rarely inject in the lower eyelid, but when I do, I use a very small amount. (Anand D. Patel, MD, Brookfield Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Typically Botox can be used to treat the crows feet which are the lines that radiate outward from the outer corner of the eyes when you squint or smile. There are also horizontal lines that can form below the lower eyelid when you smile.</p><p>I think these are what you are talking about. Unfortunately Botox does not work well for thats has they are a result of your cheek tissue moving up when you smile, not from the orbicularis oculi muscle responsible for squinting or closing the eye.</p><p>To some extent these lines will always be there and it may look unnatural to not have this when you smile. Other treatments that can be helpful in the area below the lower eyelids are fillers to soften the tear trough deformity.</p><p>A lower blepharoplasty surgery or a mid facelift combined with a lower blepharoplasty can decrease the amount of excess skin of the lower eyelid and can make those lines less noticeable. Resurfacing treatments such as laser or peels can help restore tightness and help with textural changes in the skin.</p><p>CO2 laser in particular can have a tightening effect on the skin below the eyes.
