<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Buyer beware. There are several things to consider when getting a botulinum toxin injection.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> What type of toxin are you getting; BOTOX Cosmetic, Dysport, Xeomen? The first one has been around the longest and is the most popular in the US.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Units – not cost. Toxin results are dependent on the number of units not cost. That is you have to put in enough toxin in an area to achieve the desired result.</p><p>Typically I use 25 units to treat in between the eyes, another 25 for the horizontal forehead lines and 25 divided between the crows feet.</p><p>These units are for BOTOX cosmetic. If you use Dysport you would have to multiply by the units by 3(75,75,75).</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Who is injecting and mixing the toxins. In our practice I am the only one who mixes and performs the treatment.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1624" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>With my understanding of the facial anatomy and underlying structures, I feel I offer high quality and natural treatments. My goal is to have the patient look rested and for no one to know that they are receiving any treatments.</p><p>As a national trainer for Allergan , the makers of BOTOX cosmetic, having taught Doctors and nurses from around the world how to inject, injector skills vary considerably. Ask questions and look for experience not cost, you will be hopefully enjoying the results of the treatment for 3-6 months, hopefully not regretting it. (Brian Maloney, MD, FACS, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox cost depends on number of units, injector.</h5><p>There is a wide range in Botox prices, depending on the clinic. Our clinic fee for Botox currently is $7 – $10 per unit, plus applicable HST. As an example, the most commonly injected area in our clinic is the frown lines between the eyes.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1625" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>We usually start patients with 20 units in this area, which would cost $140-$200 per treatment, depending on the injector (RN vs. MD).</p><p>Regardless who does the injections, all patients first meet with me and we formulate a treatment plan. (William Andrade, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox cost depends on the extent of your treatment. In our practice we charge per area as opposed to per specific units as our main concern is to ensure that you get the best result whatever number of units you require.</p><p>On average your cost would range between $300-$650 per total treatment depending on number of areas treated. Typical areas include glabella (that addresses those frown 11’s, forehead and crow’s feet).</p><p>Although the cost of botox is an important consideration for patients, remember that it is truly the skill of your physician that will differentiate botox that looks just right on your face resulting in natural results as opposed to botox that leads to frozen faces, uneven brows and other undesirable results. (Andrei Metelitsa, MD, FRCPC, FAAD, Calgary Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1626" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><strong>Botox Costs Deciphered</strong></p><p>The average cost for Botox on RealSelf is $525. This, of course, does not explain what was treated. In the US, most practices charge by the unit (i.e. $11/ unit)or by the ‘area’ (i.e. $250 for the frown lines (between eyes), $300 for the crows feet). You can receive great treatment, either way, as long as you are getting great results. I charge $11 per unit. This gives you the opportunity to know what it takes to get results in each area.</p><p>The most common areas treated with Botox, and ‘average’ doses for these areas, in my practice are:</p><ol>
<li>Frown Lines (Glabella, between eyes) 20 units. $220.</li>
<li>Crows Feet (Obicularis) 30 units. $330.</li>
<li>Forehead Wrinkes (Frontalis) 10 units. $110.</li>
<li>Bunny Nose (Nasaslis) 8 units. $88.</li>
<li>Vertical Lip Lines.(Obicularis) 5 units $55.</li>
</ol><p>Each patient is evaluated and the dose for each area is tailored based on the size of the muscle motion and the results of previous treatment. Most patients are very happy! Results last for an average of 4 months.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1627" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>This is why Botox is the number one cosmetic procedure in the US! (Luke J. Curtsinger, MD, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox prices may vary</h5><p>Botox is an affordable treatment for wrinkles. Before discussing the pricing of botox it is important to meet with a physician to determine if botox is the correct product for you. As some patients may benefit more from fillers or laser resurfacing.</p><p>The cost of botox depends on several factors. Some providers bill for the area treated, while others by the number of units injected. Some of the different areas that are commonly treated include the frown lines, crows feet, and forehead wrinkles.</p><p>More units of botox are required for a patient with more severe wrinkles. (Hooman Khorasani, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1628" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p><b>Botox Injections: $500 to $650 Per Treatment (40 to 60 Units)</b></p><p>The charge structure for botox injections can be extremely confusing.</p><p>Although most practitioners charge for the total number of botox units administered, some charge by the syringe or by the number of areas treated. This can make comparing the price of botox injections difficult.</p><p>In most cases, comparisons can be made by a translating syringe or areas into units. For example how many units per syringe is an appropriate question to ask. When these comparisons are made the price is usually between $10 and $16 per unit.</p><p>When transverse forehead wrinkles, vertical frown lines (between eyes) , and crow’s feet are simultaneously injected it’s not unusual to use 40 to 60 units of botox. It’s not unusual for these areas to cost between $500 and $650 per treatment.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1629" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The cost of botox, not only reflects the product cost, but the skill and experience of the injector as well. For this reason it’s important to be careful when the pricing seems too good to be true. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The price of Botox is typically by the unit. The price per unit varies somewhat from one provider to another and also depends on the geographical area. But, cheaper is definitely not always better. Providers will often drop their prices just to get people in their doors if they are not busy or trying to attract new patients/customers.</p><p>Just like with anything else, you get what you pay for. An average price per unit is $12-13. The recommended units for the frown lines is 20, forehead can range but may require 8-10, and crows feet can be between 4-8 units per side. (Nicholas Tarola, MD, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1630" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h5>Botox Price Relates to Amount Used and Areas Injected.</h5><p>The price for Botox treatments relates to the amount used, typically the number of units. There is an individual amount of units needed for the effect desired, which relates to the muscle mass in each area.</p><p>The male forehead will typically need more Botox. The price for each individual unit will vary by injector and geography. A range of pricing may be 10 to 15 dollars per unit. Botox needs to be injected accurately because if it is injected in the wrong place or wrong plane, the treatment effect is not delivered.</p><p>For the frown lines, forehead and crows feet, 35 to 45 units would be acceptable. (Andrew P. Trussler, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox pricing varies considerably form practice to practice and from region to region in the country. Doctors tend to charge more than a nurse injector, but you are getting the added experience a doctor can bring to the table.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1631" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In the Mpls-St. Paul area pricing is usually by the unit and ranges from $10-18 a unit. An average range for the frown lines may be $280-360, crows feet $200-280 and the brow $120-400 depending on how severe your wrinkles are.</p><p>Beware of severe discounts or pricing that seems too good to be true…. It usually is too good to be true. Also make sure you are getting the real Botox Cosmetic from a reputable doctor or nurse injector. (Douglas L. Gervais, MD, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox cost: ask before treatment!</h3><p>That’s like asking “How much will it cost to get my hair done?” It depends on what you have done and who is doing it.</p><p>So let’s break it down:</p><ul>
<li>Frown lines (between the eyes) usually take 20 units.</li>
<li>Crows feet, 8 to 12.</li>
<li>Forehead lines, 6 to 16 units.</li>
</ul><p>If the lines are really bad it takes much more. You’re young and will probably need less than most. In Northern California, Botox averages $12 to $20 per unit. So, if you go mid price range, say $15 unit, frown lines would be $300, crow’s feet about $150, and forehead $180.</p><p>You might find it for less but I wouldn’t shop just on price. Your doctor should develop a treatment plan for you. Many draw it on a map. Ask for a copy of it. BEFORE you’re treated, ask how much it will be, based on the treatment plan your doctor has designed.</p><p>Many doctors have nurses do the injections. Ask if touch ups are extra. (Daryl K. Hoffman, MD, San Jose Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Cost of Botox</em></p><p>Botox prices can be based on the area being treated or by the unit. When prices are based on the area it is usually broken into 3 regions of the face including Glabella (between the eyes), forehead and crow’s feet.</p><p>The cost will be the same for each patient receiving treatment in those areas regardless of how many units of Botox is utilized to achieve the desired result. The second option is to charge by the unit.</p><p>Botox by the unit can range from $10 to $17 a unit. The cost of Botox treatment can depend on several factors such as your geographical location and the provider’s injecting expertise. Where you live will be a key factor that determines how much a Botox treatment will cost.</p><p>The price will generally run higher in major metropolitan areas due to the increased cost of overhead in these areas. Providers with more experience and expertise may charge more due their specialized training. Assuming you are getting all 3 areas treated (Glabella, forehead, and crow’s feet) the average cost is $500 to$700.</p><p>However, this is only a rough estimate and will fluctuate based on the various factors stated above.
