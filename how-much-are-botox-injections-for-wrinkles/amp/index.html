<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Botox cosmetic is used to treat dynamic wrinkles of the face. Botox has become one of the most commonly used medicines for non invasive facial rejuvenation.</p><p>The cost of botox depends primarily on the number of units injected and the technique of injection.</p><p>Typically, in a saturated market such as Los Angeles, Botox is administered at 12 to 15 dollars per unit, but the amount varies depending on the depth of treatment and the degree of dynamic wrinkling.</p><p>Consult with your physician to determine the number of units required to address your specific situation. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox costs somewhere between $8-14 per unit</h4><p>Many people are worried about too much or too little Botox for giving the desired results, but you will need Botox for your forehead and wrinkle lines, which will be about $400, give or take $50 roughly.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1669" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Anything more than that, you may need to something more than just Botox. (Khalique S. Zahir, MD, Fairfax Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox cost depends on several factors</strong></p><p>The price of botox to the physician is the same everywhere. This assumes your doctor purchased botox legally in the United States. Ask your doctor to show you the bottle of botox before it is reconstituted.</p><p>It should say Botox Cosmetic. If it only says Botox, even from Allergan corporation, it may have be purchased through a foreign company. If there is fluid already in the bottle it may have been reconstituted last week or last month.</p><p>Remember Allergan recommends to use it within 4 hours of reconstitution or it begins to lose potency. Lastly the more it is diluted, the less concentrated it is, and it will wear off sooner.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1670" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Doctors that sell by the unit may have had it sitting around unless several patients are lined up to use it fresh. (Randy Proffitt, MD, Mobile Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Choosing the right Doctor for you Botox</strong></p><p>Botox can be used for a wide variety of areas to help reduce wrinkles. Depending on the area(s), it can range in price. Botox, Dysport, and Xeomin can be charged per unit or by area depending on the provider.</p><p>It is important to select a Doctor who specializes in injectable treatments and is a board certified cosmetic plastic surgeon. Depending on the areas, pricing can range from $300-$550 per area. (Stephen T. Greenberg, MD, Woodbury Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is a purified protein used to address wrinkles associated with facial expression. Pricing varies from region to region and from office to office. Finding an experienced injector is more important than finding the best price.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1671" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Look for experience, before and after photographs, and patient testimonials. Please consult with a doctor for specific recommendations. (Alex Eshaghian, MD, PhD, Encino Physician)</p><p>In general the cost of botulinum toxin to treat wrinkling will be determined by how much you need and can range from $400 to 1500.</p><p>There are three FDA approved botulinum toxins in the USA: Botox Cosmetic, Xeomin and Dysport.</p><p>Most offices charge more for Botox Cosmetic and slightly less for the equivalent dose of Xeomin or Dysport. Some offices charge by area, others by unit, but I advise you not to shop around by price.</p><p>Instead pick the most qualified physician for the procedure. Remember you are not ‘buying’ the Botox, you are paying for the procedure. (Heidi A. Waldorf, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1672" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-736b2e8538ada09cab919d1448bab1ee">

</div><p><em>Botox Cost Per Unit</em></p><p>The most important factor is the number of units used. 1 unit of Botox can cost between $10 to $15. A large area requires more Botox units.</p><p>Approx 50 to 60 units of Botox can be administered during one visit for the good result in improving the forehead wrinkles and frown lines. (Arthur G. Handal, MD, FACS, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox price depends on number of units required</b></p><p>Currently, the cost of the Botox in my practice is $14 per unit. Prior to the treatment, I always talk to a patient what would be a recommended number of units to improve the site and get the best results.</p><p>In every case, the number of units varies. It certainly depends on age, gender and depth of the wrinkles. It is very important always to seek the advice of board certified plastic surgeon in your area.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1673" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Plastic surgeons have in-depth knowledge of the facial anatomy not comparable to other specialists. (Gregory Turowski, MD, PhD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Value and results of Botox are more important than the cost of Botox</h4><p>It is important to know that Botox injection is an art and requires thorough understanding of anatomy. “Not all Botox are created equal”. You pay for the value, not just the cost of Botox. In the Northshore area rates range from $11 to 20/unit.</p><p>Pricing may be per area instead of per unit in some practices. In the hands of an experienced injector with proper concentration and amount of Botox injected and especially when done in a series of 3 to 4 treatments/year, results are fabulous! When wrinkles are very deep, Botox alone may not be the best option.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1674" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You may need fillers and laser treatments. Beware of sale prices $7/unit or lower; need to question the authenticity! (Promila Banerjee, MD, Chicago Internist)</p><h4>Botox treatments are affordable</h4><p>I have been treating patients with Botox since 1999 and have never raised our prices. A single treatment is typically between $350 and $650. The cost varies based on what areas we are treating and we customize treatments to exactly what each patient needs.</p><p>Each year I treat over 2000 patients with neuromodulators such as Botox and find that patients are truly individuals in the quantity of Botox they might need. It typically lasts 3-4 months, however not every individual needs it that often.</p><p>Some patients prefer a preventative treatment before wrinkles become deeply creased. This often allows them to space apart treatments. Seek a board certified physician with expertise in Dermatologic Surgery to perform your injections. (Carolyn Jacob, MD, Chicago Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1675" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><i>Palm beach botox fees</i></p><p>Botox fees vary with the number of areas treated, the amount and location of wrinkles, the physician’s fees as well as the region of the united states. i would not recommend price shopping for the cheapest price.</p><p>oftentimes, you get what you pay for. botox is either priced per area treated so that no matter how much or how little you need, the price for treatment of that particular area is a flat rate.</p><p>other doctors price their treatments by the dollar amount per unit of Botox and this can be a variable amount. one method will not necessarily be cheaper than the other. i would recommend calling a few places in your area to get an idea of the average rates and then find a qualified doctor whose fees are within the standard range.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1676" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>its most important to feel comfortable with your physician and be sure he or she has alot of experience with botox injections and performs a high volume of treatments annually. (Anita Mandal, MD, Palm Beach Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Price is not the most important variable</strong></p><p>Price is one factor. But of course it is not the most important factor. Ultimately you want this medical procedure done by an experienced expert that can do this safely and with the best results.</p><p>Having said this, at our practice, cost for this wrinkle injection is $12.50/unit. Or $5/unit for the European version. This works out to be approx $125 -$250 for forehead area as an example. If you use a larger amount of wrinkle injections, the cost goes down to $8.79/unit.

</div><p><em>Botox: Does it cost an arm or a leg?</em></p><p>The price ranges from your geographic area, if a physician or nurse injects you, and the amount of botox or dysport needed to improve your animation wrinkles. Typically $10-14 a unit. The typical duration of effect is about 3 months with the usual sterile saline dilution.</p><p>By adding lidocaine with epinephrine and bicarbonate extends the duration for ten days and dysport 13 days. This technique would extend the timing before reinfection and thus save some money over the year with less repeat injections necessary.</p><p>A zinc supplement with an enzyme (Zytase), has been shown to increase the effectiveness and extend the botox effect in patients who’s duration of effect has been shortened over time. This shortened effect is out likely due to an antibody attacking the foreign protein in your body. (Robert J. Troell, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox Costs</b></p><p>Different practices approach this in different ways. In general terms clinics either charge by the area or by the unit. We charge by the unit, as we think this is a more tailored approach and it is more transparent.</p><p>The cost per unit between practices, then varies depending on the experience and training of the injector. You can certainly find cheap injectors regardless of where you are located however take note, it is a matter of “buyer beware”.</p><p>Anti-wrinkle products are classifed as S4 drugs which means things can potentially go wrong so who is doing it can make a big difference. (Lisa Freeman, MBBS, Melbourne Physician)</p><p><strong>The cost of botox expertise</strong></p><p>Because Botox doesn’t work well if it isn’t injected well, there is a wide range of prices between injectors, partly based on their experience and results.</p><p>Plastic surgeons well versed in facial muscle anatomy can offer sophisticated injection techniques that not only minimize lines and wrinkles in the commonly requested forehead, crow’s feet and between the brow areas, but also provide pleasing, balanced contours to address facial asymmetry, such as uneven eyebrow heights, and uneven eye openings(aperture), depressed mouth corners, prominent neck bands, prominent vertical lip lines, raise the dynamic nasal tip, soften horizontal upper lip lines, etc.</p><p>When you compare the cost of surgery or other procedure to address these, you might find Botox is a great value. So, checkout the background and qualifications of your injector. Our office charges Botox on a sliding scale so that you pay less as your total units increase and you can afford to correct all areas!
