<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Basically, anyone can inject it, but to inject it well… that is another matter entirely. Unfortunately, Botox isn’t quite as simple as just putting it into you.</p><p>It takes skill and technique to get the really good results and typically that means that you have to have an MD, and usually a good dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon, to do it.</p><p>What I see is that many people are going to fly-by-night clinics for their Botox and it is being diluted significantly and frequently done so poorly that their results make them look worse rather than better.</p><p>Trust me, as a board certified dermatologist, I perform all of my own Botox treatments. It is that important to me and it should be that important to the surgeon you use.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2568" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-786f37e2dcabe0adfd2b6382831f14c7">

</div><p>So, basic answer: If you go to a clinic that is run by a reputable dermatologist and/or cosmetic surgeon, they should be the ones doing the Botox. If you look on the Botox website, you will find a listing based on how much Botox the doctor does. Usually a higher listing means they do more, but always look to make sure that they are the actual injectors rather than the not-so-impressive ‘nurse-injectors’.</p><p>Lastly, if you hear something that is too good to be true (incredible prices, deals galore), run – don’t walk – away! (Joel Schlessinger, MD, Omaha Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Injection Requirements Vary by State</i></p><p>Each state has different criteria that must be met to be a qualified to inject Botox. In the state of Colorado the qualifications are very broad and your injector may be an MD, DO, NP, PA, RN, MA, aesthetician.</p><p>As such, the skill of your injector is one of the most important considerations when getting Botox or other injectable treatments. Here are a few key qualifications that you should look for in your injector.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2570" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

<li>Make sure your injector is a licensed injector and that all licensing is up to date.</li>
<li>What is their experience as an injector and how long they have been performing Botox and/or filler injections? It is advisable to look at before and after pictures of the injector’s patients to see the work they have done in the past. It is important while looking at these pictures to keep in mind that a good injector listens to the goals of the patient for each treatment, and that not every patient has the same goals.</li>
<li>How frequently do they perform injections? The more frequently and consistently an injector is utilizing their skill, the more refined and precise their technique will be.</li>
<li>How often do the complete continued or advanced education. At my practice, our licensed injectors are routinely going to workshops and continuing education courses to further their knowledge and learn about new techniques and products as they become available. This training is essential beyond their initial licensing to enhance their understanding of treatment protocols, techniques and treatment options.</li>
</ol><p>When choosing a injector and comparing costs for injectable treatments, it’s also important to know that you are not only paying for the product, but also for the skill of the injector.

</div><p>There are no set qualifications for injecting Botox. One would like to assume that the person injecting is a Board Certified Dermatologist or Plastic Surgeon, and that if a nurse injector is involved, they work under one of these groups of doctors. There are very skilled nurse injectors in the field, but they should also have a supervising doctor on hand. Beware of groups who say they inject Botox, but have no clue what it does, how it works, or the facial anatomy. (Michael Gold, MD, Nashville Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox – who can inject?</h5><p>Legally, any doctor or nurse under the supervision of a doctor can inject Botox. However, like anything else, use your best judgement in choosing who administers your Botox. An MD with a good understanding of facial anatomy would be recommended to give you the safest and best results.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2572" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>My patients specifically want to have a plastic surgeon inject their BOTOX. I’d also recommend asking your friends and other referral sources about their experiences when choosing who to go to. (Catherine Huang-Begovic, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox injections – see an specialist</h5><p>Although anyone with a medical is allowed to inject Botox, not everybody has the necessary experience. Dermatologists are the specialist for the treatment of the skin, so many patients see a dermatologist for their wrinkle treatments. (Robert Kasten, MD, Mainz Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Who is qualified to inject Botox or Fillers</em></p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2573" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Botox or filler injections should only be performed by a licensed, board certified, and knowledgeable medical professional such as a medical doctor or nurse injector. When choosing a provider, do your homework. Make sure the clinic is licensed, check referrals and medical credentials, and ask to see before & after photos of their patients.</p><p>You want to ensure a safe treatment, but you also want a safe treatment with results that look and feel natural. In advance of your treatment, your cosmetic physician should discuss which injectable they are using, the number of units, any associated risks, aftercare, and pricing.</p><p>There should be no surprises! (Jia Zheng, MD, Vancouver Physician)</p><h4>Botox injectors</h4><p>State regulatory agencies govern who can inject Botox and this varies state by state. However, I also have to agree that it helps to understand the complex anatomy of each area.</p><p>Physicians and surgeons, especially have a unique understanding of the anatomy and physiology and are particularly qualified to perform this procedure. I believe that is the over-riding concern. However, clearly this may be balanced against one’s experience. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Who is allowed to inject Botox?</h4><p>In the U. K., injections containing Botulinum Toxin (often abbreviated as simply Botox) are a Prescription Only Medicine (‘POM’). Therefore before the injections can even occur, a healthcare professional who is lawfully authorised to prescribe POM’s must be satisfied that Botox is an appropriate treatment.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2569" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a67005cac22d88860b8bc554cc6dd331">

</div><p>Generally speaking only a registered medical practitioner, dentist or nurse prescriber is allowed to carry out this consultation in the U. K. and it must be done face to face with the person to be injected with the Botox.</p><p>Once the healthcare professional has decided that Botox is an appropriate treatment, they can either carry out the treatment themselves, or delegate the administration of the injections to someone else. Regardless of who carries out the injections, it is obvious that they must be properly trained in both how to inject Botox and experienced enough to recognise a complication if it occurs.</p><p>Given the fragmented state of regulation in the U. K. surrounding who may prescribe and inject Botox, my advice to anyone considering this treatment is to always find a healthcare professional registered with their professional body (if in doubt look them up online) and who is experienced in performing the treatment.</p><p>While the effects of Botox may only be temporary, it is for good reason that it is classified as a Prescription Only Medicine.
