(Anteneh Roba, MD, Fairfax Physician)</p><p>In some patients, Botox may begin to work within the first 2-3 days after injection, but I tell most patients to expect to start seeing results around days 5-7, with most results clearly evident by day 10.</p><p>Each patient is different with respect to the number of required units to achieve a certain result in a given area. In some cases, repeated injections over time may be required to fully eliminate static wrinkles (those not created with active facial expression).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3195" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The skin creases that develop take time to relax, and in some cases, may never completely resolve. In young patients, this is not typically an issue, and is more common in older patients. (Matthew Richardson, MD, Frisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Frown Lines & Botox</h4><p>I see lots of young women in my practice and deep frown lines are are a very common problem. My recommendation is to give the botox the full 2 weeks before reassessing results.</p><p>If you are still able to frown a little at this point in time then would suggest increasing the dose of botox in the frown lines. If you keep the botox treatments up over time the lines will likely improve as well (will depend upon how deep the lines originally are of course).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3196" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Filler would be an option after the botox has taken full effect if you still need some volume to to help soften the lines. Make sure you follow up with your Dermatologist to further explore your options. (Christine Malcolm, MD, Alberta Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>BOTOX EFFECT TIMELINE</h5><p>An important distinction to make is the difference between dynamic and static lines. Dynamic lines are lines that you see only on movement. They usually improve dramatically with botox. Static lines are lines that have etched in over time.</p><p>They will soften but may not totally disappear. Over time, they will improve, but may not totally disappear. Botox usually kicks in approximately 3-7 days after the treatment, this can vary from person to person.</p><p>I tell my patients it can take up to 2 weeks for the full effect to be seen. It can also vary from your last treatment you had, for example last time it may have only taken 2 days to kick in but this time it may take the full 2 weeks, that is why it is important to wait the full 2 weeks before an assessment.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3197" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Your frown lines may still be there even after botox if they were very deep to begin with and you can see them when you are at rest. You may require a combination of botox to stop the action of frowning which is causing the lines to get worse, then a dermal filler to fill in the frown line that is still visible after botox.</p><p>The dermal filler is a gel like substance made of hyaluronic acid which is a natural substance in the body, it acts like a poly filler for the face, smoothing out lines by filling them in.</p><p>Ultimately, review yourself with a doctor or nurse you trust to see if the answer if more botox, a dermal filler, or to accept there are some things that even botox has limits on. (Mariusz Gajewski, MBBS, Sydney Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3198" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Botox can be seen 2 to 3 days after injection. It can take 2 weeks to see the maximum results. (Hardik Soni, MD (not currently practicing), Summit Emergency Medicine Physician)</p><p><i>Botox takes 7-14 days to work completely</i></p><p>You typically see the results of Botox start to work in 3-5 days but the full effect is seen in 10-14 days.</p><p>Botox is a purified protein that works by relaxing muscles that cause frown lines and wrinkles in the skin.</p><p>It will often take several treatments over several months to a year to relax the muscles and smooth out the lines completely. (Miriam Hanson, MD, Austin Dermatologist)</p><h3>Botox takes 2 weeks to fully work; Dysport takes 5 days.</h3><p>Botox and Dysport both work by blocking the signal between the nerve and the muscle that creates facial expression. Though they are the same active molecule (botulinum toxin A), they are wrapped in different carrier molecules.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3199" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>This difference accounts for the fact that Botox takes up to two weeks to achieve full effect, and Dysport achieves it in about 5 days.</p><p>They both start working sooner (even as soon as the next day after treatment) but give them both time to settle in before deciding how you feel about your new treatment. (Jessica J. Krant, MD, MPH, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>BOTOX begins to work immediately but most patients do not discern a treatment effect for 24-48 hours. I personally believe that the clinical effect of these treatments is maximal at 2-3 weeks after treatment and then slowly diminishes in effectiveness over 3-4 months.</p><p>Regarding dose, age has nothing to do with how much BOTOX you need. Muscle mass is far more important. You might consider seeing an injecting physicians who is more flexible. (Kenneth D. Steinsapir, MD, Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3200" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h5>Botox works only for dynamic wrinkles; not static lines</h5><p>Remember, Botox does not work on static lines. It only works on muscles and therefore, it only smooths the dynamic lines that occur when your muscles contract! We also call these dynamic wrinkles. However, a fair number of patients will notice that their static lines actually do soften, when Botox prevents them from deepening those lines on animation.</p><p>Depending on how deep the static lines are, it may take weeks to months of “non-movement” to soften these lines. (Melissa Chiang, MD, FAAD, Houston Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox and lines</h3><p>Botox works b weakening the muscles so the skin will not fold as much. If you have wrinkles at rest when you are not flexing or using your forehead muscles, then Botox will never eliminate those lines.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3201" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You might need Botox and in addition either fillers or a laser. (Julio Garcia, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Takes 2 to 3 Days For Botox Results</strong></p><p>It typically takes botox 2 to 3 days to work. In some cases patients see the benefits of botox as early as 24 hours following injection. The response becomes more noticeable over the course of 5 to 7 days.</p><p>Botox only works for lines that are associated with muscle contractivity. In some cases, there’s tethering of the soft tissue to the deeper structures which is more or less permanent.</p><p>Under these circumstances, additional treatment with dermal fillers may be indicated in combination with botox. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox typically starts working in approximately 3 days but can take up to two weeks to become fully active. Botox is a neuromodulator meaning that it is treating/preventing the movement that causes the wrinkles, secondarily improving the lines themselves.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3202" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>After receiving an effective Botox treatment, the movement that causes the wrinkles of concern should be diminished.</p><p>For some, Botox needs to be combined with fillers in order to receive full correction. The older the patient and the longer they have suffered from frown lines, the more likely they are to need additional augmentation with fillers.</p><p>At young age, I would expect skin elasticity to provide good correction with the Botox alone. Consulting with a board-certified facial plastic surgeon, dermatologist, or plastic surgeon would be the best way to determine the proper treatment. (Umang Mehta, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox works within a few days</b></p><p>It takes about 2-4 days to see the effect of Botox, but if you can’t frown then it has taken full effect. It is possible that you may need an additional treatment such as a dermal filler (Restylane, Juvederm, Radiesse).</p><p>The peak effect of Botox is at about 2 -4 weeks and it typically lasts about 3-4 months. We found in a small clinical study that taking zinc supplements for a week before the injection may help with faster onset. (Richard Baxter, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox works in 4 to 7 days.</strong></p><p>If you are not able to frown, this means the Botox which you were treated with is working just like it should, that is, it has temporarily paralysed the muscles it was injected into. If you still have frown lines this indicates you may required some filler (Restylane, Perlane or Juvaderm) to add volume to these areas.</p><p>Your static frown lines, those present even when you are not frowning, may get better with continued use of Botox, but this may required several treatments.
