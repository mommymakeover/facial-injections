<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><b>Nothing like Botox</b></p><p>There is really nothing like Botox. At the present time, there is no cream on the market that has the same type of effect or as long-lasting results as Botox.</p><p>There are cosmetic fillers such as Radiesse and Juvéderm that are wonderful and get great results, but most of the time even cosmetic fillers work best when used in combination with Botox. (Henri P. Gaboriau, MD, FACS, Massena Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox will inhibit the muscle contractions that are causing your skin to crease.</p><p>However, wear and tear on your skin’s collagen also plays a big factor in the development of fine lines.</p><p>Microneedling is an all natural treatment that can helps stimulate collagen production within the skin and can be very effective for smoothing fine lines with the appropriate number of treatments.

</div><p>It depends on the severity of the wrinkles, but many people see good results with skin resurfacing (either a chemical peel or laser treatment) and a good skin care regimen. I would obtain a formal consultation to discuss your options. (Bryan Correa, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I am curious what it is that has you feeling hesitant about botox, it is one of the most studied drugs clinically available here in the united states and has proven to be the wrinkle treatment of choice for over 6 million people last year.</p><p>I use the product everyday and have even injected my friends and family and generally here nothing but praise for the product. If you do in fact feel adamantly about not being treated with botox you could try dysport or xeomin but both of them came to market after botox and are largely copies of botox.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2421" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Is the issue that you are worried about needles? If so I have yet to find any topical creams that are capable of providing a similar result. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Are there any alternatives to Botox?</strong></p><p>Botox is the most commonly used neurotoxin in the U. S., but not the only one available. Dysport and Xeomin are also neurotoxins used to treat dynamic facial wrinkle and act in a similar way as Botox does.</p><p>Botox and Dysport have shown to have a similar efficacy. There are studies suggesting Botox efficacy is better than Xeomin’s. In my practice I prefer Botox and Dysport. Neuromodulators are the only way to treat dynamic wrinkles.</p><p>Fine wrinkles may be responsive to skin care regimens with Retin-A or resurfacing treatments with chemical peels or lasers. (Jose Rodríguez-Feliz, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2422" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-df427de03e6a63b36d5a3a614ab89371">

</div><h5>Alternatives to Botox</h5><p>Dysport another neurotoxin recently approved by the FDA is a good alternative to Botox. With a molecular structure similar to Botox it works in the same way, keeping muscle relaxed so that they don’t contribute further to wrinkle formation.</p><p>Dysport injected into the skin is known to have a quicker onset and can last longer. Improving the skin texture and ease existing wrinkles through laser resurfacing is another potential option. This works by boosting the production of collagen and giving you a softer looking skin.</p><p>Sadly, there are no exercises or creams that achieve similar results. (Jeffrey Weinzweig, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Alternative to Botox</strong></p><p>An alternative to Botox here in the U. S. is Dysport. Like Botox, it is derived from the botulinum toxin. They both have similar effects, although I have noticed that the effect from Dysport seems to occur a bit sooner.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2423" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There is still some debate over which product lasts longer. Other products are sure to be on the horizon. (Ryan Greene, MD, PhD, Fort Lauderdale Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox wrinkle reduction alternatives</em></p><p>Dysport is an alternative to Botox which does basically the same thing. It does require injections like Botox so if your not wanting injections, this will not fit your need. But, you can go to the Botox main website and see the Botox Treatment Visualizer to get an idea how you might look with Botox. (Fernando G. Serra, MD, Clermont Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I know of no moisturizer, lotion, or potion that you can apply to your face that can be used as an alternative to Botox. Botox is a highly purified muscle paralytic that is selectively delivered into your facial muscles through a needle.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2424" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The lotions simply cannot do this and aren’t absorbed through the skin so don’t waste your money! (Jennifer L. Walden, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is a purified protein used to address wrinkles associated with facial expression. It is difficult to make an assessment without photographs. Direct alternatives to Botox include Dysport and Xeomin. These are both neuromodulators that work in the same way as Botox.</p><p>For fine wrinkles alternatives include fractional CO2 laser resurfacing. Please consult with a doctor for specific recommendations. (Alex Eshaghian, MD, PhD, Encino Physician)</p><p>There are no other products with a similar effect except other BotulinumToxin products (Dysport and Xeomin). A topically applied product has been rumored for some time, but to my knowledge does not appear to be imminent. (Maurice M. Vick, Jr., MD, Baton Rouge Urologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2425" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-2bf4d68df5193fb91b84fa6c8f88ee0a">

</div><p>Botox is the brand that has been around the longest but there are several alternatives, some of which are cheaper and just as effective. In my practice we use Xeomin and Dysport extensively. (Kapil Saigal, MD, FACS, Winter Park Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox Alternatives Dysport and Xeomin</h5><p>There are two other neurotoxins on the market to compete with Botox. The first is Dysport which is manufactured by Medicis. It works in a similar fashion as Botox but differs in that diffuses easier into the tissues and has a quicker onset. Xeomin has similarly effects as Botox but differs in that it does not have a protein initially attached in contrast to Botox. Since there are no additives you likely have lesser risks of developing antibodies.</p><p>It does not require refrigeration prior to its use. There is the impression that Xeomin works faster also than Botox. In summary these products are overall comparable in their results.</p><p>There are surgical procedures such as the open or endoscopic brow lift, suture brow lift and surgical procedures to address the frown lines as well.</p><p>There are also thermal devices with micro-needling to lift the brow along with dermal fillers. So today we have many alternatives to address the aging concerns of the face.</p><p>Some patients are looking for a more permanent solution to the problem and fortunately there are many alternatives for patients. (Robert W. Sheffield, MD, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Alternatives to botox</i></p><p>Botox Cosmetic and Botox are brand names for the first botulinum toxin A approved for the treatment of wrinkles caused by movement. In the USA, we how also have Xeomin and Dysport which are also both approved botulinum toxin A products.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2427" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>While some physicians and some patients prefer one over the other, most studies show them to be equivalent when used appropriately. Each has its selling points which you can review with your physician.</p><p>There are no effective practical alternatives to injectable botulinum toxin currently. Many peptide creams, serums and gels are on the market that contain peptides that are advertised to ‘freeze’ the muscles like botox.</p><p>These may work briefly and can be an option for a night out or photoshoot but none will have the power of injectable botulinum toxin to not only reduce wrinkles that come from muscle movement for 3 – 6 months, but also provide a softened jawline, smoother neck and chemical brow lift. (Heidi A. Waldorf, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h5>What Are the Best Botox Alternatives?</h5><p>Hyaluronic acid’s has the ability to moisturize and plump skin to give a tightening effect similar to what occurs following Botox injections. When this combined with collagen-stimulating peptides it helps fill in fine lines and wrinkles.</p><p>I would also suggest the SkinMedica TNS Essential Serum as a daily topical treatment. The key ingredients are gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), hyaluronic acid, palmitoyl tripeptide which treat the signs of aging. (Pooja Malik, MD, Cherry Hill Family Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2426" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-776df262a4772db4178d1ca60b035920">

</div><p>Botox IS the alternative to much more invasive procedures. Topical Botox is being evaluated by the FDA, so keep your eyes out for it’s release. Using a device to paralyze nerves for 3-6 months is still in it’s early stages, so look for that as well.</p><p>Minimal wrinkles can be taken care of by multiple other methods, consult your dermatologist. (Bruce Saal, MD, Los Gatos Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Alternatives to Botox for line softening include Dysport and Xeomin. They are both neuromodulators function in much the same way as Botox does. (Praven Chetty, MD, Kelowna Physician)</p><p>There are some Botox-like products, but Botox is the gold standard. I have not seen any other product perform as well and as predictably as Botox.</p><p>Botox is safe, and when administered by an exoerienced and well trained injector, the results are lasting, and natural looking.</p><p>The product is only as good as the injector, so be selective when chosing a nurse injector.
