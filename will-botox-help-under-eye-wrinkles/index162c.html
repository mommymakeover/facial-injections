<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h3>Injecting Botox under the eye area</h3><p>Botox is a muscle relaxing treatment. Some lines on the face are due to muscle contraction and so in those instances, Botox can be used to help with those lines. </p><p>A small dose is placed in the area under the eye to diminish the wrinkles.</p><p>It tends to work more predictably in younger patients where the orbital (eye) anatomy is retained with good eye lid support. </p><p>The main risk of lower eyelid treatment is that over treatment or incorrect placement of the Botox can cause an undesirable weakening of the muscles that support the lower eyelid leading to a ptosis (droopy eye).</p><p>This is a highly-specialized use for Botox and not all practitioners will have the required experience in order to be able to assess your suitability for this treatment. Furthermore, wrinkles under the eye can be caused by a number of other factors such as a reduced volume or elasticity of the skin.<br>

</div>You may therefore benefit from an alternative choice of treatment such as a fractionated CO2 laser if your wrinkles are caused by significant loss of elasticity, or a hyaluronic acid dermal filler can be used to correct the volume loss in this region.
<p>As always, the best advice is to seek a highly qualified and dedicated aesthetic medical practitioner who can guide you towards the most appropriate options and results for you.  (Tracy Mountford, MBBS, London Physician)</p><p>Yes, botox can be placed under the eye (in the lower eyelid) but one must be careful. Too much and your lower lid can sag (ectropion). You may need a lower eyelid lift which would get rid of the wrinkles.</p><p>Also consider a chemical peel. (Kurtis Martin, MD, Cincinnati Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Botox is typically used on the sides of the eyes to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.  One can have fillers put under the eyes in the tear trough area to enhance this area. 
<p>Be sure you consult with a a board certified plastic surgeon or dermatologist for optimal results. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox where and when</strong></p><p>I often put a few units on the lateral (outside) portion of the lower lid. This is to help with these crinkles.  Crinkles are very fine wrinkles and those are often best treated with laser. Possibly fat transfer could help also but you do not want fat in the actual lower lid so it depends exactly were the issue is located.</p><p>Fat transfer does well for the lower lid bags and crinkles of he cheek lid junction.

<b>Treatments for wrinkles under the eyes</b><p> I understand your concern. Botox is a purified protein used to address wrinkles associated with facial expression. It is difficult to make an assessment without photographs. </p><p>The area under the eyes is a common concern.</p><p>Sometimes Botox can be used in this area. But a very small amount must be used. It is also important that the skin under the eyes is tight before placing Botox there. The Botox will address fine lines that get deeper with smiling.</p><p>Some people have deficits seen as a line or hollowing under the eyes. This can be treated with fillers such as Volbella which restore lost volume in the area. In some cases fractional laser resurfacing can help as well.</p><p>This is common for those with loose or thin skin in the area. Please consult with a doctor for specific recommendations. (Alex Eshaghian, MD, PhD, Encino Physician)<br>

<b>Can we do Botox under the eye?</b><p>To put it frankly, your dermatologist is in the right for refusing Botox under the eye. Here is why. Small quantities of diluted Botox could help in diminishing fine wrinkles under your eyes, but this is only in carefully selected patients.</p><p>This procedure will work best for young patients who have excellent lid support. It can also be done in meticulously chosen older patients who have good orbital anatomy. This is mainly because doing the procedure on just about anybody may run the risk of developing weakened lower eyelid muscles.</p><p>The result? Patients could possibly experience lower lid rounding, which will make the eyes look aged as well as tired. Unfortunately though, being Botox providers does not grant license to perform such procedure. It is imperative to have proper education so as to have the ability to identify which patient is ideal for the treatment.<br>

</div>In addition, Botox does not correct eye wrinkles brought about by the cheeks’ upward movement. Other treatments would work best in this case. (Robert W. Sheffield, MD, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)
<h3>Can Botox be injected for wrinkles under the eye</h3><p>In my opinion, it is very important to identify the cause of the wrinkles first. If the wrinkles are due to an active muscle ( in this case the orbicularis oculi) then a very small amount in the right patient ( Good eyelid tone with no laxity ) might help.</p><p>If the wrinkles are present at rest, then Botox is unlikely to help you as in this case you have extra skin and this might need surgical removal. (Bernard S. Salameh, MD, Bowling Green Physician)</p><p><strong>It’s possible but I would be cautious</strong><br>

</div>Botox cosmetic is an amazing product that is the gold standard in the treatment of wrinkles. FDA approved for the treatment of brow lines and crows feet any off label use of Botox is administered on a highly individualized basis given the patients needs and anatomy.
<p>To answer your question, I can say that yes it is certainly possible but I would procede with caution. (Michele Ware, DO, Los Angeles Physician)</p><p>If the wrinkles you are seeing occur during facial expression, you may be able to improve them using Botox. This is a very delicate area and a detailed knowledge of the anatomy is necessary in order to avoid the most dreaded complication, double vision.</p><p>Are you talking about crow’s feet? Botox can be used around the outer corners of the eyes to address crow’s feet (wrinkles). However, if you are truly talking about underneath your eye, then your doctor is correct – you cannot place Botox below the eyes.<br>

</div>We can however place fillers, like Restylane, under the eyes to add volume and fill in some of the wrinkles under the eyes. I would need to examine you in person to determine what the best treatment for you is. (Jimmy S. Firouz, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)
<p>In summary, Botox can be used under the eyes to treat dynamic wrinkles, but you must do your research and make sure that your injector has previous experience with treating the area as the complications could be significant. (Jose Rodríguez-Feliz, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Can Botox be in nieces under the eye?</h3><p>Botox will not help the under eye wrinkling and many will notice a worsening of the baggy skin if too much botox is injected down low towards the cheek. Botox only helps the lines radiating from the outer corner of your eyes. (Katrinka L. Heher, MD, Boston Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>Yes, dermatologists can and do often inject with botox to the lower eyelid/undereye area to address wrinkles and crepiness, this is safe to do with small amount of units and works very well. (Kaleroy Papantoniou, MD, FAAD, Great Neck Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>Treating under eyes with Botox</h5><p>Yes it is possible and safe to use small amounts of Botox under the eyes. Often however the wrinkles or irregularities under the eyes are better treated with resurfacing of the skin rather than simply weakening the underlying muscle.</p><p>Of course it all depends on the individual situation. (Thomas Buonassisi, MD, Vancouver Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is not indicated for wrinkles under the eye, this can easily cause a deformity because of muscle located in that area. (Kemil Issa, MD, Dominican Republic Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Small amounts of Botox under the eyes can help</h4><p>Small doses of Botox can be injected in small amounts into the wrinkles under the eye to improve the crinkled look that occurs with animation, but it is not always effective for everyone. I would suggest seeking out a skilled injector who has a great deal of experience with Botox injections to ensure success with this procedure.</p><p>The key is that it’s not done excessively so that the lower eyelid function is not impaired. (Anil Sharma, MD, Edmonton Otolaryngologist)</p><p><em>Botox under the eye can help some, but not all</em></p><p>Botox works to relax wrinkles caused by facial muscles contracting. If your under eye wrinkles are dramatically worse when you smile, a small amount of Botox properly placed may help. However, you risk causing a droopy lower eyelid or drooping cheek.</p><p>In many cases, the wrinkles under the eyes are due to loss of elasticity in the skin. Other treatments, such as laser resurfacing or chemical peels may work better for reducing these types of wrinkles. (Matheson A. Harris, MD, Salt Lake City Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p></div>
