<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h5>Botox for sweating lasts 6-12 months.</h5><p>Botox treatments for hyperhidrosis (excess sweating) are typically effective for 6-12 months, at which time they may be repeated.</p><p>The armpits, palms, and soles of the feet are the most common areas for treatment. There are 2 surgical procedures for armpit sweating which offer permanent results:</p><p>1. The first involves using a special liposuction canula to remove the sweat glands. The procedure can be done with local anesthesia on awake patients. I have had great success with this technique.</p><p>2. The second procedure is called Endoscopic Transthoracic Sympathectomy.</p><p>This procedure is normally peformed by a neurosurgeon or thoracic surgeon. An endoscope is tunneled under the collarbone through a small incision in the armpit, and the nerve trunk responsible for armpit and palm sweating is clipped.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4122" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>A potential risk of this procedure is compensatory hyperhidrosis, which means excessive sweating that develops elsewhere (usually the face or neck). Regardless of which procedure you choose, make sure your doctor has lots of experience to ensure the best results! (Alexander Gross, MD, Atlanta Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox injection for armpit excessive sweating is not permanent and need to be repeated every year and will require 100 Unites and is injected after testing and mapping the area of excess sweat formation for precise injection. (A. H. Nezami, MD, Jacksonville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox for sweating is temporary, but is effective</i></p><p>Botox treatment for excessive axillary or hand sweating is very effective when done by experienced providers using a sufficient dose of Botox. The treatment is temporary, and should last several months. (Scott C. Sattler, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4123" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h4>Botox prevents sweating in the underarms for about six months</h4><p>Botox does not permanently prevent underarm sweating. Its effect appears to be longer in duration for hyperhidrosis of the underarms than the wrinkle minimizing effect it has on the muscles of the face which only lasts 3 to 4 months. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox and Miradry Can Effectively Treat Excessive Underarm Sweating</em></p><p>Botox is a simple and effective treatment for excessive underarm sweating. The treatment consists of a series of injections that can be performed in a few minutes and require no downtime. The results last about six months.</p><p>There is also a new treatment available to treat excessive underarm sweating called Miradry. The Miradry treatment is a noninvasive treatment for excessive underarm sweating that is effective and appears to be longer lasting. (Larry Fan, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4124" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h4>Duration of Botox for Sweating</h4><p>Unfortunately, the effects are not permanent and maintenance treatments will be needed to maintain the benefits. In our experience, the average duration is a minimum of four months with the average being seven months. Because these treatments are not inexpensive, many will choose to have the treatment in anticipation of a special event (ex: wedding, graduation, vacation) or in preparation of the hot summer months. (Harold J. Kaplan, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox For Sweating – Permanent or not?</i></p><p>When Botox is properly administered under the arm pits or on the palms or souls of the feet for sweating it tends to last approximately 10 months. This is different from the average 3-4 month duration when injected on the forehead for wrinkle relief. (Deborah Sarnoff, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4125" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><i>Botox for sweating: Lasts longer than for wrinkles!</i></p><p>Botox for underarm sweating (a relatively easy procedure to endure, about 20-50 injections with a tiny needle in each armpit) works very well when placed properly, and does last longer than treatment for facial wrinkles.</p><p>Some claim up to 1 year, but more likely 6 to 8 months in most. Some severe perspirers may need retreatment after 4 months. The cost is usually about $1000 but some insurance companies MAY help cover the procedure. (Jessica J. Krant, MD, MPH, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Need routine injections</i></p><p>You will need routine injections, however the results do last longer than when botox is used to treat wrinkles. (Mitchel P. Goldman, MD, San Diego Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox for sweating</em></p><p>Usually the Botox for treating excessive sweating lasts about 6 to 8 months on the average. However, on a rare patient I have been told the sweating never returns. This is very rare however. (Esta Kronberg, MD, Houston Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4126" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><em>Is Botox treatments for sweating permanent?</em></p><p>The effects of Botox, no matter the application for sweating or wrinkle reduction…are temporary. The Botox will need to be repeated at 3-4 month intervals. (Francis R. Palmer, III, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox for excessive sweating is effective, and may last 6-9 months or longer!</h5><p>Botox injections into the armpit area can effectively reduce, but may not completely eliminate, sweating. This may take about 100-200 units (total for both sides), at a cost of $1000 to $2000, depending on individual injector pricing.</p><p>Although this involves quite a few tiny needle sticks, fortunately there are somewhat fewer nerve endings in the armpit than on the face! The treatments must be repeated when the Botox effects “wear off.” Every patient does this to a different degree and at a specific rate, and different injectors may use variable technique and dilution, which can have an even greater role in effectiveness and length of duration.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4127" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Surgical treatment for hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) involves cutting out the sweat-gland-bearing skin, or aggressive subcutaneous liposuction of the sweat gland-bearing tissue. Other options include chemical treatments such as Drysol. Each has its own pros and cons, as does Botox.</p><p>With the surgical treatments, there is the fact that each involves an operation, healing, and scarring; with chemical treatments there can be burning, itching, skin reactions, and incomplete response; with Botox the main “con” is cost. (Richard H. Tholen, MD, FACS, Minneapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox for sweating</b></p><p>Botox injections for sweating are very effective, but unfortunately only last 3-6 months. In my patients I have found that if you continue treatments on a regular basis the effects seem to last longer. (Rosalyn George, MD, Wilmington Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4128" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><i>BOTOX and Armpit Sweating (Axillary Hyperhidrosis)</i></p><p>I have performed a fair amount of Botox injections for axillary hyperhidrosis. Most patients find the treatment easy to tolerate and moderately to amazingly effective. The amount of time of relief varies from person to person but can be as little as 3 or 4 months to as much as one year.</p><p>The amount of BOTOX I use varies from 50 units to 100 units per armpit and I typically give about 20 (painless or nearly so :)) injections. I will usually do a starch iodine test at least once on a patient to determine the extent of area to inject. (Sandy Martin, MD, Fort Myers Dermatologist)</p><p><em>Botox Temporary for Sweating</em></p><p>Botox has great benefits and can be used for a number of different treatments, from wrinkle reduction to the reduction of excess sweat (hyperhydrosis). While its effects for both are temporary, generally hyperhydrosis treatments can last for six months to a year whereas with wrinkle reduction treatments are needed every three to four months.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4129" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-849942ca5aaf2a7baa072b5eb4901d89">

</div><p>Also expect to pay a little more because, generally, more product is used. (Ava Shamban, MD, Santa Monica Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox for sweating</h3><p>This effective treatment lasts a bit longer than treating facial muscles but requires a slightly higher dose. What I tell my patients is that if this is a significant concern, see a dermatologist for evaluation of this issue as a medical problem.</p><p>It is possible that your insurance company will pay for the treatment. (Joseph Campanelli, MD, Portland Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most of my patients enjoy 6-12 months of comfort after BOTOX® for hyperhidrosis. Some come back sooner than 6 months, and others go 14 or even 18 months between treatments. To some extent the duration of adequate response depends on the dose of BOTOX®, to some extent it depends on the severity of the sweating, and to some extent it is a personal matter [some people want a higher degree of sweat reduction than on other people]. (Kevin C. Smith, MD, Niagara Falls Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Although the treatment works, you need the proper dose. Yes, you will need to repear but, you will love the results. It gets expensive after awhile. (David A. Bray, Sr., MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Is Botox for Sweating Permanent or Will I Have to Have Routine Injections, As is the Case for Wrinkles?</b></p><p>Yes it will be from my experiance the injections for sweating (mostly done for the underarms). Lasts about a year. It will require about 100 units of botox and usually costs around 1000$. (Tal T. Roudner, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox for excessive sweating lasts longer than for wrinkles</strong></p><p>Botox injected into facial muscles for relaxation of wrinkles typically lasts 3-4 months, but for the underarm area for excess sweating (called hyperhidrosis) it can last up to a year in my experience. It takes a higher dose but patients say it is well worth the cost. (Richard Baxter, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox for sweating usually requires treatments approximately every 4 to 6 months.</em></p><p>Botox for sweating usually requires treatments approximately every 4 to 6 months. As with all Botox treatments the actual time the Botox will keep you from sweating varies greatly from patient to patient. It is a great treatment for someone who has a serious sweat problem, especially in the underarms. (Mark Taylor, MD, Salt Lake City Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox for sweating</i></p><p>Works fabulously! Actually lasts longer than treatment for wrinkles – typically 6-8 months. As with any muscles, keeping the sweat gland muscles “botoxed” makes them weaker, so there will be less and less sweating the longer the botox is maintained. (Laura E. Skellchock, MD (in memoriam), Boca Raton Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>The effect wears off.</h5><p>Typically these injections are repeated every 6 months. They are not permanent. So just like with wrinkles you have benefit for a period of time and then the service wears off. Treatment can be expensive because a larger dose of BOTOX is typically used. (Kenneth D. Steinsapir, MD, Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p></div>
