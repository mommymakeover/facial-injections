<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The cost of botulinum toxin will vary greatly – but in general, I advise going somewhere that charges you per unit. That way you know exactly how much product you are getting. If you get injected by a plastic surgeon, it may cost you more – in my office we charge $12-14 a unit.</p><p>I’m sure you see ad’s that are charging Botox at a cheaper price – but most patients prefer to pay a little more to have a plastic surgeon inject.</p><p>Botulinum toxin is a technical art, and to get a good result, experience and a good understanding of a patient’s anatomy is important.</p><p>In the end, find someone with experience and ask your friends for referrals.

</div><p>The cost of botulinum toxin injections varies widely depending on your location as well as the amount of Botox you receive and who administers the actual treatment.</p><p>Allergan is the manufacturer of Botox and offers rebates and special pricing through the top providers of Botox, Juvederm and Latisse that are not available to all providers.</p><p>This can help with saving the patient money thus making the treatment more cost effective. Be careful with pricing explanations as some providers charge by “unit” and some providers charge by treatment “areas”. It can be confusing to the average patient.</p><p>I recommend choosing an experienced Botox injector with knowledge and experience in administering botulinum toxin injections.</p><p>A provider with expertise in this area may be able to give you the desired results you seek as well as being more cost effective in the long run.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1752" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Experienced injectors such as board certified plastic surgeons and dermatologists would give you the best results for your money spent. (Rod J. Rohrich, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Generally, botulinum toxin costs about $9-13/unit. There may be specials during which it costs as little as $8/unit, but that is not terribly common. Allergan, the maker of Botox, does have a Brilliant Distinctions program which gives rebates ($50 earned per treatment) for Botox, Juvederm, and Latisse (I think they’re adding Latisse to the program later this year). (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of botulinum toxin varies between different injectors, the geographic region, and the number of botox patients a practice treats.</p><p>At Richmond Aesthetic Surgery in Richmond, Virginia we charge $10 per unit regardless of the area injected.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1753" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>For the forehead and glabella region, a total of 40 units is typically injected. (Neil J. Zemmel, MD, FACS, Richmond Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Cost of botulinum toxin in Denver</h4><p>The charge per unit of Botox in the Denver area ranges from $9 – $16 per unit depending upon the provider and type of facility.</p><p>Most plastic surgeons charge the highest rate to inject Botox themselves but may also have an experienced RN in their office who is available to do it for less.</p><p>In our office, we charge $12 per unit for Botox which is the median range for Denver. (Joseph Serota, MD, Aurora Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Call around for botulinum toxin cost</h5><p>Prices vary. I charge $9 a unit to new patients and $8 to my “regulars” (patients who have had Botox injected more than three times.) However, I would recommend calling around, since sometimes physicians will charge less on Friday or before vacations.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1754" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>They may want the BOTOX to be “fresh” and not sitting around over the weekend or during vacation. (Arnold R. Oppenheim, MD, Virginia Beach Dermatologist)</p><p>Average cost of botulinum toxin does vary with different physicians. We are happy to provide Botox at a lower cost per unit as more of a perk for our patients that end up doing mulitple proceedures with us.</p><p>Average cost for our Botox is $250.00 per site. (William J. Hedden, MD, Birmingham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox cost $13 to $17 per unit</h5><p>Botox is usually charged by the unit. In our area, the average cost is $13 to $17 per unit. That being said, we are running a special of $11 per unit. Be very careful who you go to for the injection.</p><p>Price is not always the best determination. I personally would only go to a a surgeon certified by the AMERICAN BOARD OF PLASTIC SURGERY. You can find one in your area at plasticsurgery.org. I would ask that the surgeon inject and not a nurse.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1755" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Again this is just my opinion, but the training I received is far different than that of many other botox “injectors.”. (Jack Gelman, MD, Frankfort Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>The cost of Botox</strong></p><p>Botox varies by provider however we price botox based upon the area treated. The different areas that are treated include the glabella (just above the nose ), the forehead, and the “crows feet”. Our price is $520 for one area and if the second and third area are done on the same day at the same time, then those areas are $260 for each additional area.</p><p>We use only Allergan’s Botox and dilute with between 2.2-23 cc of saline. (Steven Hacker, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox is sold by the unit and/or by site</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1756" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>Ultimate cost of Botox for each patient depends upon how much product is needed. Botulinum toxin is sold by the unit &/or by the site.</p><p>Each different site would require approximately 20 – 25 units. In San Francisco, Botox generally sells for $16 – $18/unit or $350 – $375/site. (Edmond A. Zingaro, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox costs about $300 per area</i></p><p>Three areas are commonly injected:</p><ol>
<li>between the eyebrows, the so called “11” sign</li>
<li>the forehead</li>
<li>the crows feet</li>
</ol><p>A talented injector can perform a botox eyebrow lift to elevate your corner of your eyebrow 1-2 mm to give your eyebrow a classic arch and to frame your eye.</p><p>Botox can be used to weaken vertical “smoker” lines in your upper lips. Who should inject? My preference is someone that knows the anatomy well. I have seen two patients who most likely had Botox injected directly into a nerve by an inexperienced injector and had ice pick headaches for two days.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1757" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>I guess trust your instincts, but I always suggest pay for the best for food and healthcare. (Pramit Malhotra, MD, Ann Arbor Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The best way to buy botulinum toxin is by the unit. This way you know how many units works best for you.</p><p>Botox sold by the “area” is imprecise and can be used to cheat the patient.</p><p>Remember Botox is a drug, and the best way to administer a drug is to know the amount (units) and dosing frequency (3 to 4 months) that give you the best results.</p><p>Most Board Certified Plastic Surgeons will record the units given in each area and suggest a frequency for your treatments.</p><p>These numbers may change depending on your response to the treatments. In Orange County California Botox will go from $9 to $15 per unit – usually the cost varies depending on the training and experience of the injector. (Daniel Reichner, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Cost of botulinum toxin is mostly determined by number of units needed</b></p><p>The cost may vary tremendously. If it seems to good to be true, it probably is. The number of units of Botox is the most relevant number for any patient. After an initial treatment the effect and lasting effect may vary significantly.</p><p>If you bounce around between providers chasing price you aren’t doing yourself any favors. Get with a trusted and experienced professional and you can’t go wrong. After you have established a relationship you may be able to negotiate a “frequent flyer ” discount.</p><p>Price per unit may be anywhere from $9 to $16 depending on competition, geography and client base. If the treater will only discuss price per area and not per unit , be suscpicious. They shoud be very comfortable in sharing that info with you. (Talmage J. Raine, MD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>botulinum toxin pricing can be all fluff</i></p><p>How does a patient know that they are receiving the number of units that is quoted by the physician. More importantly, Botox that was mixed several hours ago or several days ago may not be as potent as Botox that was diluted several minutes ago.</p><p>My goal is to give the patient the most effective, long-lasting result. Although the unit cost to the physician is high, The best results make for the happiest patients. I usually charge by the region injected.</p><p>Some patients may pay more or less, but they are all happy. Charges range from$300 to $875. (Robert M. Freund, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
