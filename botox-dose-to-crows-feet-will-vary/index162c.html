<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>I typically use ~ 12 units per side for crows feet. I know surgeons who do more and I know surgeons who do less. The best is to taylor it to each patient.</p><p>Botox is one of those medicines that people can react to differently so remember your numbers and stick with it. We can always add more.</p><p>That is my approach. I often ask patients to return 2 wks after the injection and will “top off” areas that need it. (Benjamin Caughlin, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The FDA has approved 24 units of Botox (total) for crow’s feet correction.</p><p>However, keep in mind that as we age sometimes we need to readjust dosage or address loss of volume issues.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1845" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Temporal hollows can be an easy treatment in conjunction with Botox to erase crows feet. (Richard H. Bensimon, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If you feel this provider has suggested a treatment option that is out of line with what you have experienced in the past, I would urge you to inquire further.</p><p>This provider may be aiming to inhibit alternate muscle movements that may have begun to impact the formation of wrinkles around your eyes.</p><p>You can also always start with a smaller unit amount initially and then reevaluate 7-10 later at your follow up. (Justin Harper, MD, Columbus Physician)</p><p>Smoothing out the crow’s feet is an excellent application of Botox, and treatment of this area can also give a nice, natural lift to the eyebrows. The usual dose (per side) is around 10-12 Botox units or 30-36 Dysport units.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1846" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>That said, some patients may be better treated with fewer or more units, depending on their anatomy and whether they’ve been treated before. (Umang Mehta, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The amount of Botox recommended for a patient depends on several factors. It is an individual plan based on the amount of lines, depth of lines and how strong your muscles are working in that particular area.</p><p>Generally speaking patients need 10-15 units per side to address Crow’s feet. (Scott Chapin, MD, FACS, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>7.5 to 12 Units are the recommended doses for the crow’s feet, but there is variation in the wrinkles around the eyes. Younger patients tend to need smaller doses. Some patients have lines that track a little into their cheeks and need a larger dose.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1847" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You can always start with a smaller dose and work up to get the results you are looking for. I personally do like to have some movement in my brow and when I smile. Not every line and movement is a sign of aging and not every line should be eliminated.</p><p>Some of my patients prefer a more “frozen” look for certain parts of the face (I almost never like movement in the frown area). Discuss these more subtle changes with your injector if you know what type of result you are looking for. (Myriam Loyo, MD, Portland Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox for Crow’s Feet</strong></p><p>My typical dose for crow’s feet is 7.5 to 10 units per side. Sometimes I go up to 12.5 units per side but it would be rare for me to go higher than that. I also will often inject a small amount of Botox under the eye to help reduce fine lines and bunching of the skin, as well as make the eye more open and rounder.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1848" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I also agree with the doctor who said that not all smile lines around the eyes need to be treated. In some people, I find that the crow’s feet lines are attractive and convey a positive emotion (smiling).</p><p>This is in contrast to the glabella or frown area between the brows, where lines convey a negative emotion (frowning). (Richard Ort, MD, Lone Tree Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>The FDA recommended dose for the crows is 12 units on each side. I typically use 10 unless someone has very mild wrinkling there in which case I recommend less, and more on people who have stronger muscles there.</p><p>It is important to use enough that you actually get an effect but not so much that you change a person’s smile. (Quenby Erickson, DO, FAAD, FACMS, Chicago Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1849" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I usually inject 10 units per side when treating the crow’s feet region. I evaluate any new patient 2 weeks after their Botox treatment to see if any “touch-up” is needed. The most that I normally would use is 15 units per side.</p><p>My patients are happy with the results of their Botox for the crow’s feet using these amounts. Always see an experienced physician injector for your BOTOX Cosmetic treatments. (E. John Serrao, MD, Orlando OB-GYN)</p><p>Everyone needs to be treated according so what works for them. It is good to start at 10 units per side and work up as needed. Most patients seem to need about 25 units total for the 2 sides. (James R. Gordon, MD, FACS, FAAO, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox for smile lines</h5><p>Treating the crow’s feet around the eye serves as an excellent example of how choosing WHO is injecting you – not price or convenience (your dentist or spa) – is the most important factor to consider.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1850" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There are many variations in the patterns of crows feet that vary by individual, age, sex, expression, etc. The problem I most commonly see is that people try to take a template or cookie cutter approach with only minor variation.</p><p>There should NEVER be a templated approach with Botox anywhere! Depending on my patient’s individual needs, I do anywhere from 2 to nearly 20 units per eye, divided between 2 and 5 injection points. That gives a wide range of possibilities that is individually tailored to each patient.</p><p>My goal is to give the best possible, longest lasting, desired result with as few units as possible. This is why I said is not something to be shop for. Your highly trained injector may cost a buck or two more per unit, but you’re going to get that back in spades with fewer units used and a longer duration.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1851" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Read: choose wisely – don’t use just anyone as your injector based on price. To ensure you are receiving the highest level of care, seek out a dermatologic surgeon, oculoplastic surgeon, facial plastic surgeon or plastic surgeon who is board certified and fellowship trained in one of these “core four” cosmetic specialties. (Cameron Chesnut, MD, FAAD, FACMS, Spokane Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>The amount of Botox used in the crows feet area can vary from 8 to 24 units. On rare occasions, I could use up to 28 units of Botox. (Juan A. Brou, MD, Oklahoma City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Using Botox is an art that takes both the patient and the practitioner working together to achieve an excellent result.</p><p>The suggested number of units, from Allergan, are 12 per side but some patients need more or less. (Michael A. Greenberg, MD, Elk Grove Village Dermatologist)</p><p>The number of units to properly treat the crows feet area varies, depending on the extent of the creases and the area that they encompass. This can range from 8-12 units in most cases. In relatively young people, the wrinkles tend to be more localized, and a smaller dose can be used.</p><p>As we age, the area involved by the wrinkles gets progressively larger, and can extend onto the cheek and towards the temple. In this situation, more units will be necessary to relax the orbicularis muscle and fade the wrinkles.</p><p>I would suggest consulting with an experienced injector. They can evaluate your crow’s feet and discuss what you are hoping to accomplish with the treatment. After that, the number of units for you can be determined. (Jeffrey Rockmore, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>This depends to a certain extent on the degree of wrinkling and the size of the persons face. The crow’s feet can be treated with between 10 and 20 units in many cases. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>How many units for crows feet?</h3><p>This area varies greatly from individual to individual. It really depends on how many lines and how far they extend. In general the Botox is fanned out away from the eyes so that larger doses do not result in problems with blinking.</p><p>That being said I think it would be reasonable to let your next injector know that you have done well with the lower dose. The lowest dose possible to get the best result should be the goal. (Katrinka L. Heher, MD, Boston Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>We usually start new patients off with 9 units/side, which would be 18 units total for the crow’s feet. However, some or our patients will benefit from 20-24 units. (William Andrade, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox for crow’s feet or anywhere on face varies for every person</h3><p>Each person has a unique facial expressions, and crow’s feet lines and wrinkles vary from person to person. So there is no cookbook way to inject the crow’s feet or in fact any part of the face — each person is unique, the muscles making the lines and wrinkles are always different so there is skill needed in defining where to place Botox and how to best inject it.</p><p>In general, most require 12-15 units of Botox on each side. Again, this needs to be determined by careful examination of the muscles, and this should be done by a very skilled injector — preferably a board-certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon or someone working with them skilled in these injections. (Michael Gold, MD, Nashville Dermatologic Surgeon)</p></div>
