<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Botox can help improve and remove the lines. To help with continued improvement and to prevent deepening of these lines, try to schedule your treatments on routine intervals.</p><p>For most people it’s about every 3-4 months. Consult with your plastic surgeon about what is the best treatment regimen for you. (Anahita Azharian, DO, Wesley Chapel Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox or similar products (Xeomin or Dysport) would help to removeyour lines.</p><p>The goal should be to soften the lines, not to eliminate them completely which might not look as natural and could risk lowering the eyebrow. I prefer to start with a conservative dose of Botox and add more later if needed. Make sure to see an experienced injector.</p><p>It often helps to treat the frown area at the same time to provide balance to the upper face.

</div><h3>Botox For Forehead lines</h3><p>Your forehead lines are there at rest as well as with expression(dynamic).</p><p>Botox will help soften them but it will take time and perhaps some fillers for them to completely disappear. Laser resurfacing is an option as well to smooth out your skin and improve your skins texture.</p><p>Please consult with a board certified plastic surgeon and discuss your options. (Omar Fouda Neel, MD, FRCSC, FACS, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox will help soften the lines, and you should see some improvement. How many units is a little tricker and is often determined by the look that may work best for you (frozen vs.slight movement).</p><p>Either way, you should see some improvement and I suspect the lines will soften. If more effect is necessary, your practitioner should be able to recommend some after a good exam and skin typing history. (Peter Petropoulos, MD, Potomac Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4233" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Botox, as well as Dysport and Xeomin, can be used here to correct and smoothen the lines you are showing on your forehead.</p><p>The key for you is to find an expert injector, preferably a dermatologist of plastic surgeon who understands the most about toxins, how best to inject it, and to make sure you understand all that goes with it – and you should do great. (Michael Gold, MD, Nashville Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox will help soften your forehead lines. However, you have etched in forehead lines which means that these lines are also seen at rest. Relaxing the muscle with Botox will not completely eliminate the lines but will certainly soften them.</p><p>You may want to consider combining filler or microneedling to the Botox treatment for best results. See an experienced injector. . (Shaun Patel, MD, Miami Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4234" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Botox is measured and sold by the unit in most practices. The amount depends on the areas being injected and each practitioner’s dosing preference.</p><p>When you see your physician make sure you are very specific about your concerns and desired results.</p><p>This will allow him/her to give you an exact estimate of how many units you will need (J. Phillip Garcia, MD, FACS, Jacksonville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox (like Xeomin and Dysport) is a medication injected into target muscles of the face to selectively relax them for fewer/softer wrinkles. Forehead wrinkles are caused by an active frontalis muscle pulling on the skin.</p><p>Botox can relax this muscles; however, it is important to consider the eyebrow position and condition of the skin. I perform a full consultation for new patients for the safest results. Safety comes first.

</div><p>I believe Botox will help very nicely to reduce your forehead lines. However, I think it’s better to treat the forehead and the glabella together to avoid or reduce the risks of over compensation by the other muscles and then seeing new wrinkles or odd expressions.</p><p>Start with a conservative/ small amount if you would like not to get too much. Ask an experienced injector for a recommendation. (Aldo Guerra, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox helps with forehead lines</h5><p>Botox is a great way to improve forehead lines. It works by relaxing the muscles that create the lines.</p><p>When the lines are fixed (meaning they are present whether you are animating or not) then you have to expect many months of treatment to give a significant improvement.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4236" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Continued use of Botox over time gives a cumulative improvement which is greater than if it is only given sporadically and the muscles have had time to fully regain function in between treatments. Consult with an experienced physician for treatment. (Jason E. Leedy, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox for Forehead Lines</h5><p>You obviously lift your eyebrows a lot as one of your natural expressions. We all have our own expressions and these leave their marks on our face.</p><p>Botox will help your lines from worsening and soften any lines you make when you lift your eyebrows, however, any lines which you see in your forehead when you are absolutely relaxed will not resolve with Botox.</p><p>Botox will keep these from worsening, however, to get rid of any remaining lines, you need to treat the lines etched into the skin with a combination of laser resurfacing and skin care such as sun protection and retin-A. (Rebecca Gelber, MD, Incline Village Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4237" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>BOTOX injections would most likely smooth out the majority of the lines in your forehead. Make sure to go to an expert injector for your treatment. (James R. Gordon, MD, FACS, FAAO, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>I would recommend Botox to help improve upon your current forehead wrinkles, and prevent them from worsening. It would also behoove you to start a good skin care regimen that incorporates use of a retinol, lightening cream, and sunblock.</p><p>Be sure to see an ASPS board certified plastic surgeon in consultation to create a plan of treatement. (Nelson Castillo, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botulinum toxin, Botox, will remove the forehead lines. It will not correct 100% deep lines. The results will be better after several treatments with Botox. Couple of sessions with INFINI will help. (Liliana Manrique, MD, Vienna Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4238" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Beautiful and natural results can be achieved. Please keep in mind that etched creases may require multiple Botox treatments in order to see the best results.</p><p>I would suggest starting with 15-20 units of Botox. Please be sure to see an expert injector for an in-person consultation to fully discuss your goals and expectations in order to determine the best treatment plan. (Christian N. Ford, M.D., Boston Physician)</p><p>Botox should help to remove your forehead lines. I would recommend 15 units to start, although you may need more. I would also ensure that you are on a good skincare regimen. You would do well to start a retinol, and make sure that you wear a daily sunscreen.</p><p>Skincare in combination with regular botox can help to create a more youthful appearance. Be sure to see a Board Certified Plastic Surgeon for an in person consultation. (Anthony J. Taglienti, MD, Norristown Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The lines appear to be etched in lines. This means they are somewhat scarred. I would treat with Botox but they won’t completely go away. Even if you stretch the skin taught, the lines will be there.</p><p>Over several treatment sessions (3-4 treatments, one every 3-4 months), you will see gradual improvement of these lines. If they don’t improve to your satisfaction, laser, Infini, or fillers can be used to make them even better. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox can definitely remove forehead lines, but it must be done by an experienced injector to prevent lowering of your eyebrows. You may also benefit from adding fillers, laser or microneedling treatments. (Martie Gidon, MD, FRCPC, Toronto Dermatologist)</p><p><i>Botox and forehead lines</i></p><p>Botox is great to remove forehead lines. It has to be done by someone with experience otherwise you will end up with lower or misshapen eyebrows. One often has to add some Botox to the muscles between the eyes to balance the forehead treatment.</p><p>You should also discuss skin care with your MD and if the lines persist one can carefully add some filler. (Michael Weinberg, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox would to decrease muscle movement and therefore decrease the lines caused by these muscle movements. Seek out a consultation with a board certified plastic surgeon to evaluate your facial structure. (Terrence Higgins, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You will be able to see benefits and textural improvement in your forehead lines with Botox. Botox works to relax the muscle which helps smooth out the lines. I highly recommend you consult with an experienced inject specialist to ensure your safety and desired results from treatment. (Anup Patel, MD, MBA, Orlando Physician)</p><p>Patients who have Botox in their 20’s and 30’s will really like the effects of Botox in their forehead. Botox will freeze these wrinkles and give you a rejuvenated effect. Botox will also prevent future wrinkles in this area and give you a smooth wrinkle free forehead.</p><p>Please consult a board certified dermatologist who is an expert in Botox. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p></div>
