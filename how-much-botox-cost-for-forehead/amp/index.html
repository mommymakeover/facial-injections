<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Prices for Botox differ in geographic region. In the San Francisco Bay Area, fees are $375 to $400 to treat the frown-lines, crow’s feet, and forehead area. You will find that some office charge by the unit or by the area, but be careful of price-shopping.</p><p>In order to get your money’s worth, find a professional with plenty of experience treating patients with Botox. It’s always better to pay just a little more (if necessary) for good results. (David C. Mabrie, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox cost can vary</strong></p><p>So Botox cost varies based on how much a person needs, and whether or not your surgeon charges based on unit (10-15/unit) or by area (3 – forehead, glabella and crows feet). Some people have stronger muscles in their foreheads etc.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1577" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>All said, it can get a bit confusing – but in our practice it basically costs between 500-600 to get the entire forehead, crows feet and in between the eyebrows, and this is basically what the vast majority of our patients want.</p><p>Be sure to Trust your face to a Specialist! (Kapil Saigal, MD, FACS, Winter Park Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox prices vary based on your location. There is a surprisingly wide range; from $9- $16 per unit. Some injectors charge per area, while others charge per unit. So you could pay, for example, $300 to treat your forehead area at one location, or $11 per unit (with the average forehead injection being 12-20 units) at another.</p><p>It is best not to price shop, and instead find a skilled injector you can trust.

Butler, MD, FACS, Pensacola Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1578" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Botox Cosmetic comes in 50 and 100 unit vials. Botox is a neurotoxin and it is one of three neurotoxins on the market. The three neurotoxins are Botox Cosmetic, Dysport, and Xeomin. The vial of Botox will need to be diluted.</p><p>It is important to know that the Botox is not over diluted and you know the amount you are getting. Botox can be charged per area but this is a little concerning since everyone is different.</p><p>For example, some of us have small foreheads and some of us have smaller foreheads. It is much more accurate to charge per unit. You will know how much you are getting and what you are charged for.</p><p>The unit charge for Botox Cosmetic could be from 10 to 20 dollars per unit depending on the part of the country you are in. For example the glabella (eleven lines) is about 20 units. Sometimes more and sometimes less units.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1579" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It will depend on good diagnosis and treatment. The 20 unist could range from 200 to 400 dollars. (Suzanne Yee, MD, Little Rock Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox cost will vary widely depending on the injector, geographic location, and market conditions. Some injectors will charge per area, while others will charge per unit. Prices per unit may range from $11-$15/unit or even higher.</p><p>An important factor to consider is the experience and skill level of the injector, as this will affect the cost of any injectable treatment.</p><p>I always recommend using a skilled physician injector who specializes in facial aesthetics. (Matthew Richardson, MD, Frisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox cost varies by the area you want treated, who is injecting your Botox and whether or not you are going to a medical office. Botox is typically injected in the glabella (between the eyes), forehead or outer eyes ( crows feet).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1580" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Who is injecting your botox will have some determination on cost. In our office, Dr. Peterson personally treats his patients, so you have a board certified plastic surgeon with many years of anatomical experience. If you are going to a medical office, you will have a medical chart keeping track of your treatments, your allergies, your medical history. (Jack Peterson, MD, Topeka Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of Botox varies per Geographic area. Some practicioners charge per unit and others prefer to charge per area treated (Forehead, Glabella, Crow’s Feet, etc.). Our fee for treating the Forehead, Glabella, and Crow’s Feet is $575 (Miami, FL). (Jose Rodríguez-Feliz, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon</p><h5>Cost is important for Botox (or any procedure), but a Great Result is even more important</h5><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1581" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>As you have probably seen, Botox and fillers are readily available at countless doctor’s offices, med spas (and even other venues like airports, gyms, and shopping malls!).</p><p>It is is understandable that there is a great deal of confusion as to why the prices can vary so widely.</p><p>Ultimately, I believe that the simplest way to figure out what you should be paying for Botox is not necessarily where it is cheapest, but rather where you can get the best, most consistent results from.</p><p>After all, that is really what you are paying for, isn’t it? That is why I have always felt that charging by the area (e.g. the forehead, the glabella, around the eyes, etc.) makes more sense than charging by the unit.</p><p>Again, if you are coming to see me because you are unhappy with the deep frown lines that are developing between your eyebrows, then my job is to make that area look as good as it can–no matter how many units that might take.</p><p>If there is still movement after a week, or if the result is not lasting as long as we expect, I will place more Botox into the site at no additional charge. In my opinion, that is the simplest way to ensure that you get the optimal treatment to address your specific needs/concerns.</p><p>Also importantly, I believe that charging by area actually eliminates the motivation for over-diluting Botox. Unfortunately, I am aware of more than a few instances where patients are paying for “X” number of units, but are not necessarily receiving the actual number of units they are paying for.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1583" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The patient has no real way of knowing how much was used. These patients will often tell me, that they have been told that they are becoming “resistant” to the effects of Botox and they now require more units than before–and are being charged more, accordingly.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, when paying by area, if there are still any unwanted wrinkles/lines/movement after treatment of an area, we touch it up at no additional charge. This eliminates any incentive to overdilute the Botox.</p><p>Regardless of how Botox is charged, the take home point is that although price is important, I think that the result is even more important.</p><p>After all, cheap Botox is still a waste of money if you are not 100% satisfied with the results.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1584" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Find an experienced injector who provides you with consistent results that you love, and don’t look back. (Haresh Yalamanchili, MD, Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Cost AND Finesse should be factored in, here’s why:</h4><p>Believe it or not, Botox placement is an art. Understanding the anatomy and how to optimize Botox effect and value is not a natural-born skill. I actually use fewer units per area than many other physicians (including some whose responses I see here), but the per unit charge is higher than some I see here.</p><p>In the end, my treatments may actually come out cheaper overall…. because I use less material and charge by the unit, not by the area. The “true cost” of Botox is more complex than just the dollar number.</p><p>See a reputable physician that you trust. (Jessica J. Krant, MD, MPH, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>The most accurate way to determine the cost of Botox is to determine how many units of Botox you’ll need. This varies on the area you wish to quiet (forehead, crow’s feet, glabella, etc). I suggest meeting with a highly-trained physician for a consultation.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1582" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c5a320fa69312d561fc6cd54de925dff">

</div><p>They will be able to tell you approximately how many units of Botox are needed to quiet the desired treatment area. Botox typically costs between $12-$17 per unit in the Kansas City area. When comparing the Botox unit costs between practices, remember that you get what you pay for.</p><p>The unit cost includes the physician’s fee. (Mark A. McCune, MD, Overland Park Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox in Canada usually ranges from $9 – $16+ per unit. The number of units needed per area is dependent on the depth of the line or wrinkle. It is always best to have Botox injected by a medical doctor familiar with the subtleties of injection placement to ensure a natural result that still allows for facial movement.</p><p>Advanced injection techniques not only avoid the tell-tale “frozen” forehead; but allow for a greater degree of correction.</p><p>There are many considerations in choosing a provider including how many patients they have treated. Ask to see before and after photos of actual clients to ensure the results are pleasing and natural. (Jia Zheng, MD, Vancouver Physician)</p></div>
