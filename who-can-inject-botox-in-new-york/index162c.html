The company’s training can only include the FDA ‘on label’ indication instructions.</p><p>Those treatment parameters are rigidly defined for study purposes. In practice dealing with a variety of patients, doctors more often treat off label in order to get the best result.</p><p>That means taking into account the individual differences between patients.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2543" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Discussions of these variations are discovered by expert physicians and taught at medical specialty meetings.</p><p>To be safe, look for a physician who finished a residency in a core cosmetic specialty (dermatology, plastic surgery, facial plastic surgery or oculoplastic surgery) and spends most of her time doing cosmetic procedures.</p><p>And don’t be fooled by those who advertise being ‘board certified’ but don’t state what in what specialty. Many of those physicians are trained in family practice or emergency room medicine. And there is no equivalent certification for physician assistants or nurses. (Heidi A. Waldorf, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h3>Best and safest results with Botox: board-certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon only.</h3><p>Botox and Dysport are portrayed in the media as simple to inject, but injecting properly without risk to blood vessels or nerves, and achieving the best result– with the fewest units– in the safest way–is not only a surgical skill, but an art.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2544" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Laws vary state to state in terms of who is legally allowed to inject, and you can bet that in any state that doesn’t restrict treatments, anyone could be your injector. It’s always best to ask for specific credentials and experience level, and if for any reason you feel unsure, leave.</p><p>Never feel intimidated into getting treatment you aren’t totally comfortable with. In my opinion, treatment with these toxins should be provided only by board-certified physicians in a few narrow fields with extensive facial surgical anatomy training: dermatology, plastic surgery, ENT/facial plastics, and oculoplastics. (Jessica J. Krant, MD, MPH, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Board certified physicians should inject</i></p><p>It is important to know who your physician is prior to having a procedure performed on you.

</div><p>Price shopping is not as important as physician shopping. (James R. Gordon, MD, FACS, FAAO, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox should be an injected by a board certified physician</h4><p>All too often I see improper Botox injected by people who are simply unqualified to inject Botox. You should make sure you are being treated for this medical procedure. A board certified dermatologist who understands both the science and art of Botox.</p><p>It is a medical procedure and needs to be treated accordingly. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p><em>Botox doctor</em></p><p>While an injection of medication can be performed by any medical doctor, I would recommend that you see a core physician such as a plastic surgeon, dermatologist, facial plastic surgeon or oculoplastic surgeon who is trained in aesthetic procedures. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox injector qualifications</h4><p>Legally, anyone with a medical license or a nurse working under the direction of a physician can inject Botox. The antitrust laws against restraint of trade are applicable to the practice of medicine with the result that any doctor can purchase and inject Botox and fillers.</p><p>Many do because this is lucrative, fee for service medicine. However, caveat emptor! You should seek treatment by a board certified plastic surgeon or dermatologist who has been trained in these techniques and has the clinical judgment to know when treatment will work and when it will not be effective or when an alternative treatment would be more appropriate.</p><p>Review your physicians’ credentials and verify that the injectible has been purchased from the manufacturer and not overseas and that the expiration date has not elapsed.

</div><p><i>Who can inject botox?</i></p><p>In short, it is safest to go with a board certified plastic surgeon or dermatologist. Some nurses and physician assistants are trained well enough to do this safely, but only with a board certified physician immediately available. (Bryan Correa, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Board-certified providers should inject Botox</b></p><p>It’s a neurotoxin, and you are putting it in your face. There are potential risks and side effects associated. Your best bet is a board-certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon who has special training and expertise in this field. (Reena Rupani, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p><b>Who is Qualified to Inject Botox</b></p><p>In Australia cosmetic injectables such as Botox, Dysport, Restylane, juvederm and Radiesse are classified as a Scheduled Drug. To put things in perspective some of the other scheduled drugs include narcotics such as Morphine and Pethidine.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2548" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>In Australia, the TGA has ruled that scheduled drugs can only be prescribed by a Doctor and administered by a Doctor or a Nurse ( working under direct supervision of the Doctor). Hence every patient who has a Botox treatment should be assessed by a Doctor and then prescribed the Botox prior to the injection.</p><p>Unsupervised injecting by untrained professionals in less than ideal surroundings is not only illegal but dangerous. (Naveen Somia, MBBS, PhD, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A licensed physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant and registered nurse can all do the injections depending on what state you live in. Every state has different regulations on who is qualified to do Botox injections.</p><p>Make sure the injector is properly trained and licensed.

</div><p>Many medical practitioners can legally inject Botox into patients. However, the best trained and qualified people, in my opinion, to inject Botox are Board Certified Plastic Surgeons, Board Certified Facial Plastic Surgeons, Board Certified Dermatologists.</p><p>With regard to Botox around the eyes, Board Certified Ocular Plastic Surgeons are also qualified. When seeking a qualified practitioner, you should ask trusted and reputable physicians and when you do go to see that potential injector physician, you should ask about board certification, training, and, of course, see if you can talk to other patients that are involved in that practice.</p><p>Cut rate prices are a warning sign, and actually make sure of what you are being injected with. There is Botox brand and also other similar molecules that can have similar effects. Those brands have different levels of activity and effectiveness and may be quite useful, but are not exactly the same as brand Botox.</p><p>As a patient, I would ask to see the box and the container or jar from which the Botox was drawn at the time of injection. Also, ask whether the material was reimported, as some cut-rate Botox is achieved by reimporting Botox after it has been shipped overseas.</p><p>The bottom line here is Patient Beware. (Richard A. D’Amico, MD, FACS, Englewood Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Qualifications to inject Botox</em></p><p>The two most common specialties that inject botox are dermatologists and plastic surgeons. Many other specialties have joined in doing this wonderful treatment. As long as the doctor is educated about the anatomy of the musculature that is being treated and has ample experience in the technique of delivering botox, then the result may be as good as if they were either a dermatologist or plastic surgeon.</p><p>you should get recommendations from your general physician and friends. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Make sure they are qualified!</em></p><p>As Botox becomes more and more popular, you may be noticing that different types of doctors as well as spas are offering these treatments. To minimize the dangers I suggest using a board certified dermatologist or facial plastic surgeon, who is aware of the anatomy of the facial muscles and has had much practice. (Yael Halaas, MD, Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You can see price list and before and after photos of botox treatment performed by NYC doctors here –<br>
