In some individuals they will begin to see the effects in 24 hours whereas others take as long as 2 weeks for the full effect. On average, in our patient population, we’ve seen the Botox take effect between 3-5 days.</p><p>There is no limit to how many times you can get Botox; however, the aging process does continue for all of us and we may have to offer other procedures to you to continue enhancing your upper face as you mature. (Mike Majmundar, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most patients see results around 4-5 days. Some see changes sooner, and for some it takes a full week.

</div><h4>How Often Can Botox be Given? – and How Long Does it Take to Work?</h4><p>Botox (as well as Dysport and Xeomin – newer, but similar products — all known collectively as “neuromodulators”) have an onset of effect within 24 to 48 hours (no immediately). </p><p>The full effect will definitely be evident within one to two weeks.</p><p>By two weeks, the maximum effect should be noted. All of these “neuromodulator” products are extremely safe. In fact, these are the safest products and the safest treatments we offer in our medical offices. The molecule that performs the magic gets broken down into harmless and inactive molecules which are either used elsewhere in the body or are excreted from the body.</p><p>Therefore, using the product repeatedly causes no direct lasting damage to any cells within the body. However, these molecules act by paralyzing the muscle they are injected into, and the unopposed pull of gravity can result in some loss of tone in the muscles and some degree of “drooping” in that area over time.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_159" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>But unlike other causes of nerve paralysis (like Bell’s palsy or nerve trauma), the nerves are not damaged in the least by these injections, so as soon as the effect of the molecules wears off, full muscle function and strength can return and with it, and any drooping can resolve.</p><p>Theoretically (I don’t believe anyone has done research to prove or disprove this), the prolonged pull of gravity on the drooping muscles and skin could stretch out the skin over time, leaving the person with some extra laxity in the skin and muscles even if the muscles recover completely at some point.</p><p>Again, even though this has not been clearly shown to happen, just to avoid this possibility, I think it’s a good idea to allow all muscle function and tone to return to normal for two to four weeks, every one or two years or so, and make it a point to exercise those muscles vigorously during those “neuromodulator vacation” weeks.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_160" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Other than taking this “vacation” every once in a while, there is no reason, in terms of safety or function, to be concerned about using Botox, Dysport or Xeomin for years, or even decades at a time. (Richard Parfitt, MD, Madison Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox begins to work in 3 days.</h5><p>Most patients will notice some improvement with Botox in 3 days. For Dysport, the results may be seen as early as 2 days, especially for women.</p><p>The maximum results for both are seen at 2 weeks. The effects of both Botox and Dysport will start to wear off by 3-4 months.</p><p>If you re-inject Botox or Dysport as soon as it starts to wear off, and do this consistently over a 2 year period, then the facial muscles that have been injected with Botox/Dysport will gradually shrink (disuse atrophy), and then the effects of Botox/Dysport will usually last longer, 4-6 months (as long as you keep re-injecting as soon as it wears off).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_161" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There is no limit on the length of time that one can keep getting Botox/Dysport, although there are very rare cases of neutralizing antibodies developing to either of these with prolonged use; in the rare event that this does happen, then switching from Botox to Dysport (or vice versa) should be able to give similar results. (John Troccoli, MD, FAAD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p><strong>How soon can Botox results be seen?</strong></p><p>The results from Botox can start as soon as few hours but can take up to 2 weeks for full effect. It really depends on each person anatomy and their response to treatment. (Mariusz Sapijaszko, MD, FRCPC, Edmonton Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox, How long until a result can be seen</h5><p>We tell patients to give Botox a full ten days to see a result. However, the majority of people start to see a result within 3-6 days. On occasion, even sooner. The effects of Botox generally last 3 – 6 months.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_162" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>People typically schedule appointments for more Botox soon after they notice they have movement where they didn’t have it previously. I have patients who have been receiving Botox regularly for over 15 years, stopping only for pregnancy and breast-feeding. (Michael Law, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox results can be seen within 3 to 7 days</em></p><p>Initial Botox results can usually be seen within 3 to 7 days, with full results appearing after 2 weeks. There is no limit to how many times a patient can receive Botox. Many people use Botox for years with no detrimental effects.</p><p>Botox generally lasts around 3-4 months, and as soon as it wears off you can have it done again to maintain your results (Jonathan Kulbersh, MD, Charlotte Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Typically results are seen in seventy-two hours. Sometimes you can see the Botox working sooner. If wrinkles are very deep, the botox may paralyze the area, but the wrinkle is still visible. In these cases the wrinkle has to heal. (Burton M. Sundin, MD, Richmond Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_163" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Botox works beneath the skin’s surface and targets the underlying muscle activity that causes frown lines and crow’s feet. Most of my patients begin to notice results within 24 to 48 hours and the full effect is seen after 2 weeks and typically schedule follow up appointments 3 months post treatment as to maintain their results.</p><p>Results can last up to 4 months and you may receive Botox injections indefinitely as long as you are being followed by a specialist. (Omar Fouda Neel, MD, FRCSC, FACS, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Onset of Botox</em></p><p>Botox typically becomes effective for most patients after seven days and stays optimized between ten days to 3-4 months. Its competitor, Dysport, also a neuromodulator, may become effective a little faster, around after four days, and stay effective for about the same amount of time.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_164" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>For patients who are new to me, I usually see them back after two weeks to determine if I need to add more neuromodulators. There is no limit as to how long patients may continue with neuromodulator treatments, except for a couple of scenarios.</p><p>One that comes to mind is if the patient no longer responds to the neuromodulator, due to antibodies developing in the body against the neuromodulator. This can happen spontaneously. If it occurs, patient may try a different brand.</p><p>Another scenario is when there is muscle atrophy in the injected area, which can happen after years of repeated neurmodulator injections. This may be a desired end point–as the muscle atrophy, it may not be able to cause wrinkles. (Laura Phan, MD, Los Gatos Physician)</p><p>Typically, it takes approximately 3 to 5 days to start to see visible results with a peak effect at 2 weeks post treatment. The industry standard is to keep Botox treatments spread out a minimum of 90 days between treatments.</p><p></p>

</div>Once you are treated with Botox you can continue receiving Botox treatments for the duration of your life. There is not a minimum of total times that an individual can receive Botox. (Scott Chapin, MD, FACS, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)
<h3>How long does it take to see the results of botox and how long does it last?</h3><p>Neurotoxins take a few days to start working. Most patients start noticing changes 2 to 3 days after the injection but expect 5 to 7 days for the full effect to take place. Because of the delay in action you want to plan in advance.</p><p>Botox is still the more popular brand in the market but other competing brands are Dysport and even Xeomin. The effects last 3 to 5 months depending on the dose and site. Most of my patients get repeat injection every 4 months, but some patient even do it twice a year.</p><p>You will feel the effect gradually wear off and will want to come back for repeat treatment.
