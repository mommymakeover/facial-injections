<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Botox prices can vary between 8-15 dollars per unit depending on the practice. Some offices have you purchase a whole vial, while most charge you for just the amount that you use.</p><p>Our practice charges by the unit rather than the area of the face injected, because different patients need different amounts injected.</p><p>For example, the glabella (frown lines between the eyebrows) can require 12-20 units depending on the patient. Crows feet may require between 4-12 units per side. The forehead may require 8-20 units total. (Daniel J. Givens, MD, Dubuque Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The price of Botox is typically by the unit. The price per unit varies somewhat from one provider to another and also depends on the geographical area.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1596" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>But, cheaper is definitely not always better. Providers will often drop their prices just to get people in their doors if they are not busy or trying to attract new patients/customers.</p><p>Just like with anything else, you get what you pay for. An average price per unit is $12-13. The recommended units for the frown lines is 20, forehead can range but may require 8-10, and crows feet can be between 4-8 units per side. (Nicholas Tarola, MD, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox $10-$15 per unit</h5><p>Some offices charge per area treated, but in our office we charge by the unit. Some offices charge less, but we charge $15/unit. We are board certified dermatologists and dermatologic surgeons, and because of this our patients tend to get better results and are very satisfied with our treatments.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1597" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Some injectors can use more units but if they’re not placed in the correct location you can end up with less than optimal results or with adverse effects. Additionally if you are getting charged by the facial area, you may be paying much more than $15/unit if they don’t tell you how many units per area they’re using.</p><p>Botox is a wonderful cosmetic procedure that can be very affordable. (Erica Linnell, MD, Bellevue Dermatologist)</p><p><strong>Injection skill and aesthetic vision is more important than price</strong></p><p>Most doctors charge by what’s called the unit, just like most doctors charge by the syringe for injectable fillers. Some doctors try to charge by the area or the outcome but this is very difficult to do for the practice due to trying to keep inventory and account for their stock, which is extremely expensive to buy and hold.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1598" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>But ultimately it’s Ok to ask the price as long as that is only one factor in your decision. The typical range for toxin or Botox injections is $10 to $18 per unit ( could be higher in certain places like Manhattan or San Francisco).</p><p>The typical number of units for correction could be between 20 units and 66 units and even more of you are a man (bigger muscles need more units) or add other areas (neck, lips, and jawline as well as the chewing muscles to slim the face).</p><p>So when you do the math is winds up being about $300 to over $1000.</p><p>Once you know the range you should consider that most offices that offer toxins at the lower end of the range usually need to offer it at that price because they don’t have as much business.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1599" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Doctors that inject Botox at parties or at beauty salons are doing it because they don’t have enough business in their own offices. In other words, their primary goal is to make money ( sorry if I am offending those physicians).</p><p>Injecting toxins well involves understanding the anatomy intimately but also in conjunction with a myriad of factors of each individual face. The surrounding muscles, the type of skin, the symmetry or lack of it and then a difficult to teach “eye” to understand how to bring the most attractive outcome for each individual.</p><p>Finally a great injector will also know by looking at someone how to avoid side effects and when something that can’t be accomplished can be explained. There are ways to save money on toxins. The major companies have points programs ( Brilliant Distinctions and Aspire) and these are great ways to shave the costs down.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1600" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>We have occasional specials and points of our own as well as rewarding people with reduced costs if they come in within 4 months of their last treatment. Finally, sometimes people are having a tough time financially so we reduce the amount they use for awhile or only do 1 or 2 areas instead of 3 or 4.</p><p>Try to find someone with a passion for aesthetic medicine, who really wants to create an artful result that is individual for you and wants to make a long term relationship with you. This is the way you will get the best value for your money. (Amy Forman Taub, MD, Chicago Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>$8 – $14 a unit</i></p><p>We charge $13 a unit because I do the injections and I lecture nationally on injection technique and provide instructional courses for docs. At spas, often nurses do the injections. Not all injections are created equal.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1601" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I often see docs injecting in areas where the muscle is either sparse or absent, and either go too deep or too superficial. Waste. There is an art to it, so be careful who you elect to do the job.</p><p>It isn’t reversible. And if it is done properly, you can get more out of less toxin. So cost per unit isn’t the thing to look for to ensure the “best deal.”(Tim Neavin, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox cost varies from Doctor to Doctor</b></p><p>Botox is priced per area (For example, $350 per area) or by the unit (For example, $13 per unit). It is sometimes helpful to ask how many units were used in your treatment so that you may have consistency when having another provider treat you, and to make sure that the botox is not excessively diluted.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1602" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>When a “vial” of botox is purchased by the company, Allergan, who makes it, there are 100 units. This is then diluted with saline at the discretion of the Physician. So make sure your are getting all of the units that you are paying for to get the results you desire! (David Rankin, MD, Jupiter Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Our current cost is $12.50/unit which equates to about $250-$400/area. Be sure to check the qualifications of the provider you are going to for plastic surgery procedures. (Jason Brett Lichten, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox generally costs around $10-20 per unit depending upon who/where the injector is and how much they want to charge. Some areas of the face and forehead that will be treated may need more units than other areas, so each area may be a different price.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1603" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Typically, the area between the eyes or the “11” is treated with around 20units of Botox and it lasts about 3-4 months. The forehead may require a bit more and the peri-ocular lines/crows feet may require less, but this will depend on the opinion of the injector. (Benjamin J. Cousins, MD, Miami Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Albuquerque Botox: $8 to $13 Per Unit</h4><p>At New Mexico Facial Plastics, we charge $8 to $13 per unit of Botox. This is the general range that most practices charge. Why the variability? As with other clinics, we often run specials for our existing clients.</p><p>Clients who come to us on a regular basis are also eligible for discounts. From time to time we offer deals on neurotoxins through Amazon Local and Living Social. If you purchase one of these deals, either through the site or directly from us, you will get an amazing price per unit.</p><p>I meet with each patient individually to understand what result you are looking for to make sure that we are giving you exactly the amount of Botox, or other neurotoxin, required for your result. I prefer to start on the conservative side, and encourage patients to come back within a week if they want a stronger effect.</p><p>Its easy to add a little more to get a stronger result–and its better to be in that position than to feel like you got too much! (Farhan Taghizadeh, MD, Phoenix Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I charge by the area for my Botox treatments. This way you have no surprises when you check out. I charge about $12/unit which comes to about $300/area. You can always ask to be charged by the unit.</p><p>Sometimes this does come out a little less. Also, sometimes I customize your treatment and use fewer units than usual. In this case I always charge by the unit. In my office you will always have your treatments by me.</p><p>I mix all the product , do all the injections and always use fresh Botox mixed that day. I have been using Botox since 1996.
