<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The cost for Botox varies from location to location, between $10-$15 a unit. My practice is located in Seattle, WA and I offer the first 30 units for $269 and each additional unit at $12.50/each.</p><p>The $269 price is locked in for future visits. (Javad Sajan, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The price of Botox is about as variable as the weather in different parts of the country. Factors impacting cost include city or rural, doctor or salon, number of areas treated, etc</p><p>The best option is to pick the doctor that you want to provide the treatment. This is a medical treatment, and in my opinion, the best way to avoid complications is to have a doctor trained and experienced with the treatment perform the procedure.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1651" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I would recommend a doctor whose specialty involved the use of Botox including dermatologists and plastic surgeons.</p><p>Since the product itself is very expensive, my concern with locations that charge extremely low prices is that the Botox is diluted to the point that amount or duration of improvement is limited.</p><p>Overall, the cost will likely be about the same at whichever qualified doctor performs the procedure, but the advantage of decreasing the risk of complications and getting the improvement that you want is priceless. (Andrew Kaufman, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox costs in Orange County and Los Angeles</em></p><p>Botox in the Orange County/Los Angeles area range from $10.00-$14.00 per unit. Each person is different to how many units they may need.

</div><p>Allergan has a program called Brilliant Distinctions that offers discounts and reimburses the patients every time you use an allergen product which means additional savings to the patient. (Patricia Faraz, MD, Ladera Ranch OB-GYN)</p><p>The cost will vary depending on your area and who is injecting the Botox, a nurse is generally less expensive. In Utah the cost is usually around $10 per unit if a physician is injecting. (Kevin Rose, MD, Provo Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>How much does botox cost?</i></p><p>This depends on how many units you require. The vast majority of Plastic Surgeons will base the cost of the Botox on the total number of units injected.</p><p>Different Plastic Surgeons and Cosmetic Surgeons who use Botox will set their own “price per unit” meaning, 1 Unit may cost $10.00 for one surgeon while another it may cost $15.00.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1653" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>So, if you see a Facial Plastic Surgeon who charges $10.00 per unit and you need 20 units, the cost will be $200.00 plus Tax (depending on where you live).</p><p>This is just an example to highlight how most Facial plastic surgeons charge for a Botox treatment. I wrote an article on this topic and it may be helpfull to take a look sometime. (James Bonaparte, MD, MSc, FRCSC, Ottawa Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Cost of Botox in Los Angeles</i></p><p>The cost of Botox in Los Angeles varies by practice according to several factors including: Who’s doing the injections? Generally speaking, it is more expensive when a physician injects than a nurse, NP or PA.</p><p>Where are procedures done? Generally it is more expensive at a traditional medical office than at a medical spa, Botox party or other informal location. How experienced is the practitioner? Generally speaking, more experienced practitioners can charge more because they provide better results and have a more established clientele.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1654" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Prices for Botox in our area of Los Angeles and Orange County generally vary between about $8 per unit for the lowest priced providers to up to $20 per unit for the most exclusive practices. By area, we have seen it vary from about $150 – $350 but areas are defined differently at different practices. (Harold J. Kaplan, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Cheap Botox is never good and Good Botox is never cheap. Desired results are a result of an experienced doctor performing the injection. Botox pricing can vary from Doctor to Doctor, depending on the type of Doctor, or the geographical area of the Doctor.</p><p>So I am sure NYC is much more expensive then a more rural area. In my area, I have seen Botox selling for 12-18 dollars per unit.

</div><p>Botox pricing is a little interesting. Many patients are concerned about how much a unit of Botox costs, when what they should really worry about is how much it would cost to fix the problem they are concerned about.</p><p>If Botox isn’t dosed properly or if it’s not injected into precisely the correct location, then it isn’t worth much at all, even it’s cheap, since the result is not going to get rid of the problem.</p><p>However, when performed by an experienced injector, even if the Botox is more costly per unit, the end result is a solution to the problem, and that would be worth every penny. (Andrew Campbell, MD, Milwaukee Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox prices will vary greatly</em></p><p>The price of Botox in a reputable practice will typically vary, depending on the amount of Botox that is necessary to achieve the desired goal.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1656" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

Basically, it is usually by the unit, but that can be misleading as well.</b></p><p>Unit pricing for Botox would seem to be the best way to calculate costs. The problem with this is that units can vary as Botox is a crystalline powder when it comes from the manufacturer.</p><p>Beware of ‘cheap’ Botox as it is usually watered down. (Joel Schlessinger, MD, Omaha Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Cost of Botox is not very expensive, $10 per unit. It should be repeated every three or four months. Something like getting hair styled.

</div><p><strong>How much does Botox cost?</strong></p><p>The answer is complicated because Botox costs more when it is purchased from authorized US sources and not diluted to the point of being useless. As a patient, it is really important to understand this when choosing who to see.</p><p>In general, doctors or injectors that are purchasing from illegal sources may or may not be using Botox. When you hear about Botox “deals”, ask some questions. In my office, we charge based on the amount of product used.</p><p>Unfortunately, patients usually do not ask about this but instead just ask how much a “syringe” of Botox is.</p><p>This is not the measure one wants to use because if one is being injected with saline that has 2 units of Botox, it is a very expensive injection – even if it only costs 200. (Kenneth Beer, MD, Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of BoTox is usually dependent on how much BoTox you receive, within a safe dose range. When you see a “low” cost it usually means that you will be receiving less BoTox than another, higher quote.</p><p>The medication is diluted so how far a bottle goes depends on the dilution. How long the medication is effective is important for you and this can be dose related to a degree. There have been doctors that injected “research” grade BoTox in the past.</p><p>It is less expensive but NOT for human use. I hope this practice has stopped. (Michael Kulick, MD, DDS, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox Pricing</b></p><p>Botox comes in vials of 100 units, and it costs the physician around $5-6 per unit. The markup the patient sees depends on the skill level of the injector and the region of the country you live in.</p><p>I charge $14-15/unit, and will typically use between 20 to 60 units to achieve the desired result. When you are “shopping” for Botox, it is not smart to go to the least expensive provider, as you will likely be selecting someone who has less of a skill set.</p><p>By the same token, it is wise to ask how many units are being used, so you will be able to compare the treatments between providers. (Michael A. Bogdan, MD, FACS, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>What a patient pays for botox really depends on the doctor he/she is seeing. Each physician may charge a different ammount – like anything else retail. You can call several offices in your area to find out the average costs.</p><p>I would be careful with the office that charges a lot less than others. The most expensive office may have a more exclusive client base. More experienced doctors may charge more. (Gary Goldenberg, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p></div>
