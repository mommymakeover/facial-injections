<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><i>Botox begins working within 3-5 days after injection.</i></p><p>Botox’s full benefit generally occurs in 3-5 days after treatment. However, it may take up to 2 weeks to see the full result. We instruct our patients to be patient for about 10 days. If there is a question at this time, then we ask them to see us in the office.</p><p>There is not a limit to how much Botox you can have. Patients have been treated for years for a variety of medical disorders which use large doses of Botox than we typically use for facial wrinkles.</p><p>I am a Botox user as well and have used these treatments for more than 10 years.

</div><p>Most patients will notice some results from Botox Cosmetic in 3-5 days. Maximum benefit can take 10-14 days. (Michael Sullivan, MD, Columbus Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox typically takes effect after 3 days and reaches maximum effect by 2 weeks.</p><p>For this reason, any touch-ups (additional Botox) should not be injected prior to 2 weeks as the Botox is still taking effect.</p><p>Results typically last 3-4 months, depending on the number of units and the area injected.</p><p>Botox can be injected as needed; there is no limit. (Joseph A. Eviatar, MD, FACS, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>Once Botox is injected it takes at least 2 to 3 days to see some changes and in 7 days its full effect will be evident. In some cases it takes a bit longer to see the full effect of the Botox injection.

</div><p>It might take up to 2 weeks for the results of Botox to fully kick in and settle.</p><p>There really is no limit on how many injections you can take over time, but some patients might gradually develop some kind of resistance to Botox which might cause them to need more units too see same results as before.</p><p>In such cases, we can switch patients to other products such as Dysport or Xeomin. (Elham Jafari, MD, Irvine Physician)</p><p>This varies patient to patient but typically after 3-4 days the Botox will start to take effect and after 10-14 days the results are at their maximum effect. After the 4th day you will start to notice that your muscles will have appeared more relaxed and throughout the next 10 days you will see the final results take place. (Saul Lahijani, MD, Los Angeles Physician)</p><ol>
<li>How long after receiving Botox do you see the full benefit? There is a lot of variation here! The results tend to come on over around 7-10 days. I always suggest a review at 2 week point as this is when it will be in maximum effect.</li>
<li>How many times can one receive this? I know it is every 4 months, but is there a limit to how long one can keep getting botox? My clients on average attend 2-3 times a year for re-treatement.</li>
</ol><p>I generally advise no less than every 3 months as there is some evidence to suggest that having botox too often can increase your risk of becoming resistant to the product. (Rupert Critchley, MD, MRCGP, London Physician)</p><p>Most patients begin seeing improvement in the areas of botox or xeomin injection within 3-5 days. The effect then peeks at about two weeks and relaxes slightly. Most patients obtain 3 1/2-4 months’ benefit. (Jon A. Perlman, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_865" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h4>Time to onset of Botox</h4><p>Botox gradually takes effect over about a 7 days with maximum results between 7-14 days. It is important to keep in mind that if you have a special event coming that you should try to get your Botox done 2-3 weeks in advance as that gives you an opportunity to get a touch-up or refinement should you need one.</p><p>Often the refinement is done about a week to 2 weeks after the initial Botox. A refinement is more common the first time you have Botox done and the first time with a new injector. Botox lasts 3-4 months and if you get it done regularly before your muscles regain all of their activity, you will reap the benefits of prevention more so than if you let the muscles fully regain activity between treatments.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_866" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The additional benefit of getting retreated before you are completely worn off is that it can sometimes mean you don’t need as much and refinements are not as necessary. In regards to how long you can keep doing it, there is not a limit.</p><p>There is no age restriction and most people like the look so much they prefer to keep it up indefinitely. (Quenby Erickson, DO, FAAD, FACMS, Chicago Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox timing</strong></p><p>Botox usually takes 7 days to take full effect. We like to re evaluate in 2 weeks. There is not a limit to how long one can keep getting botox. (Christofer Buatti, DO, Detroit Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>When you start to see the effect of a BOTOX Cosmetic treatment</b></p><p>After a BOTOX Cosmetic treatment you can expect to see results within 5-7 days post treatment. Some patients see results more quickly than that and others take a little longer to see the full effect.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_867" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>That is why we would book a follow-up visit 2-3 weeks after you receive your injection. If you are a regular patient and receive treatments every 4 months, then you will eventually most likely) be able to stretch your treatments to 4.5 or even 5 month intervals. As far as there being a limit, there is none. As long as you wish to have the cosmetic benefits of the treatment, you may continue to have the procedure done at the interval recommended. (Manish Khanna, MD, FRCP(C), Montreal Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox benefit, how long until you see results</strong></p><p>Each patient can be a little different as to how long it takes until you start to notice your Botox result.

</div><p>Botox is fully set up within two weeks. If you are not seeing a result after two weeks you should return to the office that treated you. You may require additional units. Botox normally requires treatment about every three months when you first start.</p><p>You really need to retreat once you notice you are getting some movement back. The idea is that you cause muscle atrophy and weaken the muscle over time. There is not limit for how long to have the treatment.</p><p>Once you stop treatments your skin will return to normal. I hope you found this helpful.,Michael J. Brown, MD, PLLC Learn more:. (Michael J. Brown, MD, Ashburn Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Takes 2 Weeks to See Full Benefits</strong></p><p>Botox begins working 3-5 days after injection, but full benefit peaks at 2 weeks. We have a policy at all our offices that if you need a correction of any kind within 2 weeks, we’ll do it for free! This way, we can make sure you have exactly the amount you need, where you need it most.</p><p>There’s no limit for how long you can use Botox, because the toxin is fully cleared by your immune system. Effects last anywhere from 4-6 months, and I find those that have been doing it longer usually have a longer effects each time.

</div><p>The Dysport® protein is slightly smaller allowing it to work more quickly; 2-3 days after treatment. For people wanting to look good for an event, trip, etc. with short notice, Dysport® might be a better option since results can be seen faster than with Botox®.</p><p>Occasionally when Botox doesn’t seem to work as long after years of injection, switching to Dysport seems to help in many. The end result is the similar from the patient’s longevity. (Jed H. Horowitz, MD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most of our patients see results from their Botox injection between five and seven days. The full benefit may not be apparent for up to ten days. Touchups may be warranted after that. After their first treatment I recommend that my patients wait until they see a minimal amount of muscle activity before returning for their next injection.</p><p>They can then schedule subsequent injections accordingly. There is no age limit or time limit for the use of Botox that I know of. (F. True Lansden, MD, Key West Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
