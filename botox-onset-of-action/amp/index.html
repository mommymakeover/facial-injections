<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Botox typically starts to work after 4-5 days, with complete onset within 10 days. You should see the creases in the treated areas start to flatten in that time frame, and with repeated use, the wrinkles continue to diminish.</p><p>Botox usually lasts 3-4 months, so you will need to be treated 3-4 times per year for maximal results. </p><p>There is no limit for the number of times that you can be treated, and most of my New York patients continue treatments for years.</p><p>For the best results, I would suggest visiting a plastic surgeon to evaluate your needs. A skilled injector should place the botox, as it is an art to achieve natural results. In some offices, this is a nurse injector, while in others it is the plastic surgeon. (Jeffrey Rockmore, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Typically Botox takes anywhere from 3 to 14 days to onset. You should receive Botox treatment only once every 3/4 months (not including touch-up treatments). (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)
<p>Usually 3-4 days, but some patients will begin to see the effects within 24 hours. The effects peak at about 2 weeks and usually last 3 months. Remember, these are averages and so the onset and duration may be shorter or longer for you.</p><p>Also, the various forms of Botulinum toxin (e.g. Botox, Dysport, Xeomin) are slightly different chemical preparations and, though not proven, may work better or last longer for you than in someone else. (Anand D. Patel, MD, Brookfield Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Depending on the Dose injected and the specific Botulinum Toxin Product used the results can appear within 48 hours and have full effect within a week. Studies have shown than in some patients the onset of action of “Xeomin” is faster than with “Botox”. (Victor Michalak, MD, Issaquah Dermatologic Surgeon)<br>

<i>Botox works within 3-4 days; less time in some people</i><p>The onset of muscle paralysis by Botox injections is usually at full effect about 6 or 7 days after the injections. Typically, you will see a change in 3-4 days and feel a little tightness of the overlying skin.</p><p>When you try to frown or move the area of the face that was treated, you can tell the effect in the mirror. </p><p>Some patients report a bit of muscle slow down as if it is working as soon as 1 day after the injection.</p><p>Botox should last around 3-4 months. If you are routine about getting it you may be able to space treatments out even further. </p><p>There is no statement really on the limit to how long you can keep getting Botox, although safety and efficacy data suggest that this is a predictable and safe method to treat certain areas of the face over time by qualified and trained professionals.<br>

</div>Botox has been used in other fields besides cosmetic surgery for many, many years, and is FDA approved for specific cosmetic purposes now. (Jennifer L. Walden, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)
<p><i>Onset of action of botox</i></p><p>Botox works by weakening muscles. Results are typically seen in 3-7 days and peak by 10 – 14 days. The results typically last 3-4 months after treatment, although some can go longer before needing repeat treatments. (Hooman Khorasani, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>How quickly does Botox take effect?</i></p><p>Botox typically takes about 3 days to start taking effect, but it can often take up to 7-10 days to achieve your maximum result. Having said that, I have found that people who are consistent with their Botox treatments notice their initial effects as quickly as 24 hours and the full result within a few days.<br>

</div>Moreover, many of my patients who have had Botox regularly for several years, often note that the results start to last longer than the 3-4 months they would see initially. (Haresh Yalamanchili, MD, Houston Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<h4>ONSET OF BOTOX RESULTS AND REPETITION</h4><p>The results from the actual Botox molecule injected usually manifests itself within one to seven days. Its maximum effect takes place in a couple of weeks and then, depending on the rate at which each patient’s body metabolizes the Botox will determine how long it lasts.</p><p>Most people get four to six months reliably; others will get much longer. I have had patients get a year to a year and one half; however, this is completely variable from patient to patient.<br>
</p>
<div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_923" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div>The initial dose of Botox is also important because the dose may need to be larger in people with large frown muscles, particularly in the glabella area or the “11’s”, so in some places the dosage should be varied as well, and this can change the affect.
<p>In terms of how many times it is okay to keep getting Botox, there have been patients getting Botox once or twice a year for years, and I am not aware of any data that limits the longevity or number of total injections. (Richard A. D’Amico, MD, FACS, Englewood Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most patients notice results in 3-4 days. You might expect to feel a difference a little bit earlier. No studies have been done at this time to determine if there is a limit to how many times a patient can undergo Botox injections. (Paul B. Johnson, MD, Philadelphia Oculoplastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h3>How Quickly will BOTOX Work</h3><p>Results vary considerably from patient to patient. Most patients will notice the onset of effect within 2-7 days. According to the medical literature the peak effect continues to build for up to a month. </p><p>The effect of the BOTOX may run from 0-9 months, with most people experiencing an effect for 3-4 months.</p><p>As long as you are experiencing effects there is no limit to how many years you can receive the BOTOX. (Brian Maloney, MD, FACS, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Onset of activation of Botox</em></p><p>Botox typically takes 3-7 days to take effect. By 2 weeks, Botox has taken full effect. I usually suggest a 2 week follow-up after the initial injection of Botox to see if the patient needs any additional units. (Alan N. Larsen, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Botox once injected, takes 10-14 days to show it’s full benefit. Some of my patient’s report that they feel their Botox starting to work by day 2 after using 2 CC preserved saline to dilute a 100 Unit vila of Botox.
<p>To date, I have not come across a study that suggests a time limit for Botox use. (Praven Chetty, MD, Kelowna Physician)</p><p><b>Botox onset</b></p><p>Although you may start to see the effects of Botox after a day or two, it really takes a full week before you can see the full effects.</p><p>I often ask my patients to return back in two weeks so we can reevaluate and possibly make any adjustments if needed.</p><p>Some areas me take you and longer to take affect such as the masseter muscles. I encourage patients to come back in about three weeks to reevaluate. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Long term use of Botox and time of onset</h3><p>Botox has been in use for well over 30 years. Some of the advocates of the cosmetic uses, namely a husband and wife physician team, recently reported a well tolerated and excellent safety record of many patients receiving Botox over a 15 year period.</p><p>To date, there have been no recommendations regarding limitations on the long term use of Botox. With regard to time of onset following injection, the package insert describes a 3-5 day period. However, I have injected and observed many patients who demonstrate a response witihn 24 hours. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox takes effect very quickly</h4><p>After receiving a Botox injection, you can see results within 4-6 days. The onset of Dysport (a competitor to Botox) is even faster, with some patients seeing a difference within 24 hours. You can continue to receive Botox injections as long as you wish- typically, people notice they need to maintain it every 3-4 months.</p><p>Many patients have begun using it as a preventative measure against aging, not just when they see greater fine lines and wrinkles. (Cory Torgerson, MD, PhD, FRCSC, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox Effect First Seen in 2-3 Days; Dysport Can Be Noticed in 2 Days</h3><p>Botox usually has its effect within the first 2-3 days after the injection, and it can take up to 7 days in some. Most reputable injectors will see you back and perform a touchup at 2 weeks if needed.</p><p>It is important to note that at this time we have 3 FDA-approved neurotoxins on the market: Botox, Dysport and Xeomin. In the original Botox clinical trials, we did not look at days to onset that critically – it has been done since and 2-3 days seems the norm.</p><p>Dysport did look at this in their clinical trials – and its onset was quick, usually in 2 days. Most say that if you need to have toxin that works in 2 days, Dysport may be for you. Xeomin also looked at this and also works quickly. (Michael Gold, MD, Nashville Dermatologic Surgeon)</p></div>
