<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>It can take several days for Botox to take effect (for it to kick in). You should see the full effect within 10-14 days.</p><p>According to the manufacturers of Botox (Allergan) it can last 3 months, but I have many of my patients that report their Botox lasts longer.</p><p>There is no limit to how long one can continue getting Botox as long as you still see it’s benefits. (Sheila Barbarino, MD, Austin Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is one commercial form of the neuromodulator botulinum toxin A. It is the most commonly used product among its class (others include Dysport and Xeomin). Botulinum toxin works by blocking the transmission of signals from nerve endings to muscle.</p><p>Depending on the product the effects can take fro 3-10 days to set in. For Botox its about 5-7 days. For Disport is a little quicker closer to 3 days. If you have a neuromodulator treatment expect to notice some effects by 5-7 days.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_879" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If the results seem asymmetric or not what you expected, I would wait a full 10 days then see your doctor to discuss your concerns. For most patients the effects wear off in 3-4 months. It does depend on the individual how often they will need to be treated.</p><p>It is safe to use as long as you are not pregnant, breast feeding and do not have any neuromuscular diseases. You can continue to be treated with botox ever 3-4 months as long as you like.</p><p>Some patients observe after several months or years of regular botox treatments, their frown or forehead muscles weaken to the point that they need less treatment or less frequent treatment. There are also reported cases where a patient may develop antibodies to a certain product but may still be able to have an effective result from a different preparation (different brand) of the toxin.

</div><h3>Botox Effect starts in 2-4 days. As Good as It Gets in 2 Weeks</h3><p>I counsel patients that they will start to see something in about 3 days, then it is as good as it gets at 1-2 weeks. I like to see new patients back at 2-4 weeks to evaluate the effects.</p><p>I always learn something, and sometimes a little tweak can take a good result to an outstanding result! This yields valuable information for future treatments.</p><p>The average result lasts 4 months, but everyone is different. Some people have very active enzymes and chew up the Botox in 3 months, and some people have a great effect for 6 months.</p><p>I have been using Botox for about 15 years. I don’t believe that there is a limit. Some patients report a diminished effect over time, and others, just the opposite, believing that the muscles atrophy and shrink over time.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_881" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I don’t know if this has been studied. For most patients, it keeps on working, over and over. (Luke J. Curtsinger, MD, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Some Botox results can usually be seen after a few days</em></p><p>Generally, visible Botox results can be seen after just a few days, although it may take up to two weeks for complete results.</p><p>Currently there is no limit as to how long a person can keep getting Botox; it is a very safe procedure, and there is no research to suggest that there are adverse long-term effects with many years of treatment.</p><p>Botox usually lasts around 3~4 months before needing a touchup. (Kimberly Butterwick, MD, San Diego Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Twelve days for maximum effect. </i></p><p>Maximum Botox effect is about twelve days. I inject my patients every three to four months. I myself have Botox every three months if I have the time. Botox will rarely last longer than that.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_882" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You may have Botox for as long as you want , but not perhaps as often as you want. Botox more frequently than every three months is usually not advisable. (Ruth L. Hillelson, MD, FACS, Richmond Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>How Long Before Botox Kicks In</em></p><p>Botox takes about 3-4 days to start kicking in and usually takes about a week for the full effect. In some patients, it takes up to two weeks to see the maximal effect. </p><p>The results usually last about 3-4 months on average.</p><p>In some patients the results don’t last as long, but if you’re one of the lucky ones it can last up to six months. There is no limit as to the number of times you can receive Botox.</p><p>Botox is such a great treatment because it is truly preventative. It prevents lines from forming in the first place. In general, the earlier you start, the better, before any lines become etched in.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_883" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-6aaa92a21cd6736f863e7ba688b56fd0">

</div><p>There are two other good products that compete with Botox- Xeomin and Dysport.</p><p>These products provide the same results and are a good value. In my Denver practice, we charge slightly less for Xeomin compared to Botox and patients see the same excellent results. (Richard Ort, MD, Lone Tree Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox results can usually be seen anywhere from 3 to 7 days following injection, with full results appearing after two weeks. There is no limit to the number of times you can have Botox. Many patients have Botox done every three or four months for years with no negative effects. (Kory Kitagawa, MD, Honolulu Dermatologist)</p><p>It takes up to 1 week for the botox to take full effect on relaxing the muscles injected. There is no limit to how often you can receive it, as long as you wait sufficient time between treatments (3 and a half months at least). (Richard A. Zoumalan, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_884" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Some patients say they can see some results in as little as three to four days while most patients see their full effect at two weeks. I like to see all of my new patients at two weeks to evaluate the effect of their Botox and to “touch-up” any areas that may require additional units.</p><p>The results should last three to four months and again that is dependent on the patient, dilution rate, number of units and injection technique. When my patients have established their optimal outcomes they return for maintenance visits every three to four months.</p><p>Many of my patients have been using Botox for years and there are currently no studies that limit the use of Botox or any other neuromodulators (E. John Serrao, MD, Orlando OB-GYN)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_885" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><h5>First Signs Visible in a Few Days</h5><p>Typically, it takes about 3 to 5 days before you will notice the first effects of BOTOX injections. But some patients may not see any changes for a week or so. Every person’s experience is unique.</p><p>If no change occurs after 10 days, you should contact the injector and express your concerns. </p><p>As for limiting the number of BOTOX treatments, there is no evidence that long-term use of BOTOX poses any risks, and building up a resistance is rare. (Suzanne Bruce, MD, Houston Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox will take 3-7 days to begin its effect, with the full effect being by day 10-14. It is safe to have Botox injections long term, and has been shown to reduce the development of lines and wrinkles with regular use.

</div><h5>Onset of action from botox</h5><p>most patients start to see the effect of botox by the 5th day, but some take as long as a week or two to see the maximal effect. It usually wears off by the fourth to fifth month. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox Results Can Be Seen Starting After 3 – 4 Days.</em></p><p>Most patients will notice significant results after 3 or 4 days but it may take up to 14 days to see the full effect. While Botox typically works the same on forehead wrinkles, crow’s feet and frown lines, the injections tend to work more quickly on smaller wrinkles.</p><p>So if you have small crow’s feet around the eyes but bigger forehead wrinkles, you may see results happen more quickly in the relaxation of the crow’s feet. (Anil Sharma, MD, Edmonton Otolaryngologist)</p><p><strong>Botox effects can be seen in 2 to 5 days</strong></p><p>The onset of action for Botox typical takes 2 to 5 days to be evident. For shallow creases along the forehead and glabella (frown lines) the onset is rapid. For deeper creases in these areas it may take 1 to 2 weeks to see an effect.</p><p>The mechanism of action for Botox is to weaken the muscles underlying facial creases. Once the muscle is weaken, the creases will smooth out over time. For lifting of the brow the effect is typical quicker and results can be seen in a week or less. (Neil J. Zemmel, MD, FACS, Richmond Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox typically takes about 48 hours to START working, and usually takes 7-10 days to take FULL EFFECT. This is just a range and can vary slightly between patients. You can receive Botox every 3 months, there is no limit other than that.</p><p>You can keep getting botox for life! Awesome right 🙂 (Brian Arslanian, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
