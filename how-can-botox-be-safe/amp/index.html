<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Botox Cosmetic is extremely safe, with few side effects, and virtually no downtime after your treatment. Normal side effects that you could experience include bruising, minor pain, or swelling at the injection site. Rarely, Botox may migrate to an unintended area, but to avoid this – do not rub or massage the treated area.</p><p>Droopy eyelids are a rare result of the Botox Cosmetic migrating to a different muscle group, the one that controls the upper eyelid. This can cause an eye that will not open fully. Droopy eyelids can be the result of too much Botox injected to an area, or the injections being too close to other muscles.</p><p>My most important advice, to make sure your Botox treatments have no bad side effects – only see a board certified and experienced physician (dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon – not a dentist!) for your procedure.<br>

</div>Never use an unqualified practitioner, and do not have Botox injections from a temporary site at a mall or in someone’s house. (Narin (Joe) Apisarnthanarax, MD, Houston Dermatologist)
<p>Botox is a very safe product to use when applied with the proper skills. Understanding the underlying facial anatomy is critical to a successful outcome.  (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is very safe and effective in the hands of a physician who is familiar with the anatomy of the ocular region. If too much Botox is given, injected improperly or migrates to tissue where it does not belong, complications can occur.</p><p>These include a ptotic (droopy) eyelid, strabismus (crosses eyes) and dry eyes as a result of poor eyelid closure. Fortunately, these problems usually resolve within a couple of months. It is therefore critical to find an experienced oculoplastic surgeon for Botox injections around the eyes. (James R. Gordon, MD, FACS, FAAO, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Botox is very safe with minimal side effects. Botox only lasts 3 months, so if you did get a droopy eyelid it would subside when the Botox wears off. An experienced Botox injector would be able to adjust the dosage and technique to prevent a droopy eyelid from occuring again.
<p>Make sure you have a board certified physician perform or supervise your Botox injections. (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is a really safe and effective treatment. The best plan to keep yourself safe and make sure the outcome of the procedure is exactly what you want, is to visit an EXPERT injector. The majority of the problems arise when people have visited an inexperienced injector who injects improperly.</p><p>That’s why its important to choose a specialist and is ultimately the best way to avoid these sorts of results (i.e.: droopy eyelids) (Cory Torgerson, MD, PhD, FRCSC, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<b>Ensuring safe treatment with Botox</b><p>Finding a skilled and experienced injector will be the most important step in avoiding untoward side effects from Botox. Things you can do as a patient to avoid side effects is to avoid massaging your face, lying down flat or exercising for 3 hours after your injection. (Donald B. Yoo, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is safe and side effects are uncommon. The anatomy of the muscles and layers of fascia around the eye usually protect Botox from traversing past the brow and into the levator palpebrae muscle which lies mostly within the bony confines around the eye.</p><p>This muscle is the main muscle that lifts the eyelid and when it is paralyzed you can have a droopy eyelid for 3-4 weeks afterwards. Extra measures are taken by avoiding injections too close to the brow.<br>

</div>This prevents most droopy eyelids but they can still occur. It is also important that the injector use small concentrated volumes to prevent migration. Other tips for the patient are to avoid laying down for 4 hours after the treatment and refraining from strenuous activity that could possibly cause migration. (Kristina Tansavatdi, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<h4>Botox is safe- make sure you have a proper physician that is injecting</h4><p>Botox is safe. Eyelid drooping is a possible reaction but is uncommon. It is best to see a Facial Plastic Surgeon who frequently performs Botox injections and is most familiar with the facial muscles and aesthetic effects Botox has. (Michael Sullivan, MD, Columbus Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The likelihood of eyelid ptosis, or drooping of the eye lids is not as common particularly if you have the proper administrator, meaning a board certified dermatologist or facial plastic surgeon. Botox has been FDA approved in the United States for years, and has had a vast amount of positive feedback and safety trials.<br>

</div>In addition I would avoid massaging the injection sites for about 24 hours after the procedure.  (Yael Halaas, MD, Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Botox is considered to be generally safe and has received FDA approval as a result. Like any other form of medical treatment, there are associated side effects Botox, such as droopy eyelids. In order to help ensure that your first experience with Botox is a successful one, it is essential that you choose an experienced board certified specialist who can properly evaluate you for complications and side effects.</p><p>For example, Botox is contraindicated in individuals with neurological conditions. Your doctor will be able to communicate with you as to whether or not you are at risk for adverse consequences. (Sanusi Umar, MD, Redondo Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h4>Avoiding Side Effects with Botox</h4><p>While Botox is extremely safe, it can have some bad side effects if not used properly. Botox works by relaxing the muscles. If too much product is used, there may be a potential for the muscle relaxing too much, like drooping an eyelid or eyebrow.</p><p>Botox has been used for over 20 years, and has numerous medical applications beyond relaxing wrinkles. The maker’s of Botox provide training for eligible injectors. It is important to make sure you are seeing a physician that is appropriately trained.</p><p>At our practice, only the board certified dermatologists inject Botox, to ensure the most precise and accurate results are provided to each patient. (Robert A. Weiss, MD, Baltimore Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox and safety</h3><p>The cosmetic use of botox is safe. There have never been any deaths or permanent effects. A droopy eyelid occurs when botox infiltrates into the muscle that lifts the eyelid. It can happen to inexperienced and experienced injectors alike.<br>

</div>It is probably more likely in an inexperienced injector’s hands. There is nothing to really prevent this complication except the obvious. I wouldn’t start massaging the botox near the eyelid after the procedure.
<p>I would probably not go exercise for an hour or two. I have had botox injected myself and never had a problem and have not changed my lifestyle or behaviour after injection. I remember there was a general plastic surgeon who used to tell patients to spend several hours in a dark room after botox injection to reduce side effects but this is not scientifically tested.</p><p>Just something that he came up with in his mind..most people do their usual activities and do fine. (Chris Thiagarajah, MD, Denver Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox is extremely safe and effective</h4><p>Botox is very safe.  My best advice to you is to go to a board certified dermatologist who has alot of experience injecting Botox.  Droopy eyelids can be from too much Botox or Botox injected into the lower forehead.</p><p> I always tell my patients to refrain from bending forward or exercising the day of the procedure to minimize side effects.  Also stop aspirin or any product that can cause bruising for a week before your injections.</p><p>We have a complete list in our office which we provide to all of our patients before treatment. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h3>The Most Important Tip for avoiding problems with Botox</h3><p>There can be no doubt of the safety of Botox. It is reliable, and patient satisfaction is overall extremely high. When patient satisfaction after Botox IS experienced, it is almost always attributable to inexperience and poor technique on the part of the injector.</p><p>There are many reasons that nice people like yourself are being led to believe that anyone can inject Botox and the results will be equivalent- but common sense says otherwise. Are human beings exactly the same in any other way? Of course not.</p><p>We all are capable of learning and storing information and experiences and if we love what we do, we can expect to become more proficient as time passes. I would ask your girlfriends about their Botox experiences (taking into consideration what you think about their outcomes) and find someone you like and trust.</p><p>When done well, Botox should be minimally uncomfortable, and give you a very natural and attractive outcome.
