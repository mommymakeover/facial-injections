The textbook answer will be 3-5 months but let me make some additional comments.</p><p>I have some patients that state it lasts 6 months.

</div><p>Some areas that have larger or more frequently used muscles tend to metabolize the product faster resulting in shorter results.</p><p>Botox tends to not last as long in older patients over 60. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Duration of Botox treatment</h5><p>Generally Botox treatment lasts 3-4 months — however when using Botox to treat underarm perspiration it can last 7–9 months. Our patients enjoy their treatments and we are happy to work with their budget to give them the result they desire. (Brian Coan, MD, FACS, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox duration</b></p><p>Face Botox duration is based on the dosage. With a full correction treatment, you can expect the Botox to last 3-4 months time. There are some areas, however, where you may want to use lower doses and repeat the treatment more frequently such as around the mouth or the forehead. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_828" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><strong>Botox lasts 4-6 months</strong></p><p>As a platinum injector in New York City – Meaning we are among the biggest injectors of Botox, we have a ton of experience using Botox for the past 15 years. While Botox lasts different durations based on an individual patient’s biology, it usually lasts 4-6 months. To be on safe side – plan on Botox to last 4 months. (Dennis Gross, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p>There are several neuromodulators on the market and Botox is just one of them. Depending on the area of injection, Botox typically lasts between 3-6 months and 4 on average. In order to maintain the effects or benefits, injections should be repeated before full return of function of the treated muscles. (Nicholas Tarola, MD, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>BOTOX can last anywhere from three to four months, although some can go longer before needing repeat treatments. Some factors that can affect the longevity of your injections include your body’s metabolism of the toxin and the strength of your muscles.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_829" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Because of this, people with stronger muscles may need more BOTOX to achieve the desired results. (Leonard Hochstein, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox effects</strong></p><p>The length of time that Botox lasts varies based on many patient factors. On average, we see our patients coming in for injections every 3 to 4 months, although some have them at 6 months. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Typically in the majority of patients Botox lasts 3 months, but I have seen it last for 4 – 6 months in a few patients. I have also seen a few patients where Botox lasts for 1 month or less and in 2 patients I have seen NO response.</p><p>The Non responders or Partial responders to Botox are due to the antibodies produced by the body against the proteins in the Botox. There is a new product called XEOMIN that is a next generational toxin and is a pure form of the Botulinum Toxin without the stabilising proteins.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_830" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Hence the risk of antibodies are low and hence the incidence of Non responders or Partial Responders will be negligible. (Naveen Somia, MBBS, PhD, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Face botox typically lasts 3-6 months. The national average is a bit over 15 weeks. I know that sounds like a huge range, but it’s true. I’d say my average Botox patient comes in about every 5 months.</p><p>Some patients just metabolize the toxin faster than others, and there’s no real way to know beforehand. Injecting in key anatomic areas, however, is essential for getting the longest impact for your treatment. (Bobby Buka, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h4>Botox longevity will vary</h4><p>Botox generally lasts 3-4 months but some of my patients who have had injections for years tell me they see a definite difference for 6-8 months. (William Andrade, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_831" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b8fde550580d16b61feba6240a055a2c">

</div><p>Botox typically lasts 3-4 months. Some people metabolize it more quickly than others. However, with continued use and injections, over time, the Botox will begin to last longer and longer between treatments. This is because Botox stops your underlying muscles from being used and creating those fine lines and wrinkles.</p><p>These muscles weaken under the power of Botox and without use they will atrophy, and you’ll get the added bonus of noticing you can last a little bit longer between Botox treatments. (Cory Torgerson, MD, PhD, FRCSC, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox Life is Averaged to be 4 Months</strong></p><p>The average amount of time between treatments is 3-5 months. Botox has been studied to last upwards of 4 months. (David L. Robbins, MD, FACS, West Des Moines Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>4 months in the first year on the average</em></p><p>Typically if you want the botox to efface your wrinkles you will need to get a treatment regularly. The first 5-6 treatments are usually done every 4 months. After that, usually one sees that the effect lasts longer, five, even six months.</p><p></p>

</div>I have patients under treatment for over 5 years who only need one injection per year. (Alexis Verpaele, MD, Belgium Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Botox relaxes the muscles by entering the end of the nerve fibers and stopping the release of the molecules that fire the muscle. The body responds by growing new nerve endings which takes 3-4 months.</p><p>Sometimes Botox can “last longer” if you keep up with it. This is simply the atrophy of the muscle from not using it. Some of my patients can last 9 months without a Botox redose, but that is after years of buliding up to that level starting at every 3 months. (Jason Mussman, MD, Phoenix Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox usually last between 3-4 months. Some patients feel that they can go longer between treatment as others want have treatment as soon as they feel the product is wearing off.</p><p>Treatment should be done as often as you feel comfortable with and is usually determined by the look you are trying to achieve. (Hannah Vargas, MD, Kansas City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox lasts on average 3-4 months. Patients who use it regularly may get longer out of each treatment. I have some patients who come in every 3 months, some who come in every 6 months, and others who come in once a year.</p><p>The size of the muscle (male vs female) and the amount injected may determine how long each treatment will last. (Ralph Trey Aquadro, MD, Auburn Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_834" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a93e47936855586b15a8f8c34ed2c8df">

</div><p><b>Botox Lasts 3 to 6 Months</b></p><p>In my experience injecting Botox for over 3000 patients, I have seen it last for anywhere from 3 to 6 months. Most patients begin to see movement return to the treated areas around the 4 month mark. Some patients are naturally more resistant to the Botox, or have stronger muscles.</p><p>These patients usually require more units of Botox, or may want to explore other options for treating their area of concern. Another factor in how long Botox lasts is its freshness. At New Mexico Facial Plastics, we do not store Botox.</p><p>We order it fresh for each patient. This ensures that each patient is getting the strongest Botox available, and is getting their money’s worth. (Farhan Taghizadeh, MD, Phoenix Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>3-4 Months</b></p><p>The best results will last from 3-4 months. Most of our patients come back every 4-6 months. (Frank L. Stile, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox in the face is quite variable upon how long that will last and it depends upon several factors. These factors are:</p><ol>
<li>strength and size of the muscle injected</li>
<li>wrinkles and dermal atrophy that is present</li>
<li>how much Botox( units) were injected</li>
<li>which muscle was injected with Botox</li>
<li>some patients have antibodies to Botox so it doesn’t work.</li>
<li>How many times Botox has been injected in the past in the same area</li>
</ol><p>The average length of time that Botox lasts anywhere from 3-8 months.(William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>We typically tell our patients to expect the results to last from 3-4 months and the vast majority of patients fall in this range. We do have a small percantage of patients in our practice that find their results last in the 4-5 month range.
<p>An even smaller percantage may only be in the 2-3 month range; I have noticed that a few of my female marathon runners fall in this category. (William P. Mack, MD, PA, Tampa Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Longevity of Botox</i></p><p>The longevity of Botox in the face is about 3 to 4 months according to the companies data sheet. It depends which neuromodulator is used, concentration of the injected solution, how long you have been getting treated, your body metabolizem and other factors.</p><p>Most commonly in my practice it has been 4 months.
