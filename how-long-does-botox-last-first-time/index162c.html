<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Typically Botox lasts approximately 3 months. However, if you are diligent and have regular treatments performed over the first 2-3 years, you will find that your results will begin to last longer and longer. (Theodore Diktaban, MD, FACS, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>BOTOX LASTS 3-4 MONTHS FOR THE FIRST TIME , BUT LONGER IF USED REPEATEDLY</em></p><p>Botox lasts on average 3-4 months. Should a patient receive Botox injections over a prolonged period of time, the duration of subsequent injections increase. (Carlos Cordoba, MD, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox typically lasts between 3-4 months. However, in some patients can vary in duration from 2 months to 8 months.</p><p>With consistent repeated injections, patients duration will typically last longer. In my office, we recommend 4 month intervals and found most patients can reach this level with consistent repeated injections. (Anil R.

</div><p>Botox usually lasts abut 3-4 months for most people.</p><p>Depending on how strong your muscle movement is and how fast your body metabolizes the product, your results may vary. Some people even report Botox lasting 5-6 months. (Steven H. Williams, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox duration can vary but, in general, the average duration is 3-6 months.</p><p>Many patients say that some treatment long ago lasted X amount of time but then had a recent treatment that lasted Y amount of time.</p><p>It is important to know how many units have been injected — as the number of units of Botox injected is the most relevant, controllable variable that can determine longevity. Some providers charge per area; patients have the right to be aware of how many units have been injected.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_837" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

(Jhonny Salomon, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In most cases, Botox lasts 3-4 months. For some patients, it will last a bit longer. Also, certain areas of the face may have a bit longer or shorter duration of effect depending on the muscle and skin thickness.

</div><h3>Botox duration for the first time</h3><p>Botulinum toxin treatments vary in different people, but it is usually 3-4 months. However, keep in mind that the decrease in the drug’s action is gradual and doesn’t go away suddenly.</p><p>There are some patients who elect to have it all wear away (or that’s just when they notice it the most) and others who come in regularly every 3 months because they do not want to see the action return. (Michael M. Kim, MD, Portland Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox wears off slowly…it’s not like a light switch…gradually loses effectiveness with more needed on average every 3-4 months…can last longer or shorter times depending on lots of issues…remember there’s a lot of variability depending on your age, the extent of your wrinkles and the amount of botox used…let’s say you really need 30 units to an area but opt for only 10 units, then of course the benefits will not last as long and won’t be as complete in removing movement…and don’t forget the effects gradually wear off…it’s not like a light switch – either off or on… (Ken Landow, MD, Las Vegas Dermatologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_839" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p><em>Botox Cosmetic duration is generally 2-4 months.</em></p><p>On average, the effects of botox may last 3 months for most people. However, there are occasions when we may see a patient back as early as 2-2 1/2 months from their original treatment.</p><p>On the other hand, I have several male patients that I have seen for years who come in once per year and absolutely swear that the effects of their botox lasts them one year!</p><p>I do believe that some of the prolonged effects may be from training yourself not to recruit those particular muscle groups to make the expressions that you originally had Botox placed in the first place. (Sanjay Grover, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Typically, Botox will last about 3 to 4 months. Some patients will have it last linger. In our offices experience, we see the hypermetabloic, (gym aficionado), and very expressive patient come in sooner. (Jeffrey J.

</div><p>Botox typically lasts 3-6 months, but we have had reports of the effects occasionally lasting a year or more. We tend to like to under-promise and over-deliver at MPS and so I tell all my patients to expect a 3 month duration. (Adam David Lowenstein, MD, FACS, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox Dysport and Xeomin Last 3-4 Months for Most Clients</em></p><p>Botox , Dysport and Xeomin start working as soon as 2-7 days. They work their best at 30 days and for most remain effective for 3-4 and occasionally 6 months.

</div><p>Strength or weakness of your underlying muscles. (Mark Berkowitz, MD, Sterling Heights Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox usually lasts about 3-4 months for the first time and sometimes longer if you have been getting regular injections. To some extent, it will depend on how many units were injected. (Thomas Guillot, MD, Baton Rouge Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox Duration</h5><p>Typically Botox lasts approximately 3-4 months, although some can go a little longer. However it can be dependent on a few factors such as the person as well as how he or she metabolizes the toxin, the strength of his or her affected muscles, etc… If you have very strong muscles, you may notice that you need more units and perhaps may need to get additional injections slighlty earlier. Once a patient starts getting neurotoxins on a regular basis, people may start to notice that they can go longer before getting “touch-ups”.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_842" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Typically it takes anywhere from 3-5 days before the neurotoxin starts to kick in. (Diane Walder, MD, Miami Dermatologist)</p><p><i>Botox lasts three to six months with an average of four months.</i></p><p>Typically, Botox lasts approximately up to four months. At my practice, Cape Fear Aesthetics, we generally have our patients return three and a half months after the initial follow up. In addition, we have noticed that some patients, over time, are able to wait longer in between appointments when being consistent with their Botox injections.</p><p>Think of it as forming a habit. Once it is learned it takes longer to change the habit. (Edward E. Dickerson, IV, MD, Fayetteville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox lasts 3-6 months</em></p><p>Botox typically lasts 3 months for the first time, but can have some effect lasting as long as 6 months. Most patients who regularly have it injected do so every 4-6 months. As long as you haven’t developed a tolerance to the drug, you can expect this result, although there are rare people for whom it isn’t effective. (Matheson A. Harris, MD, Salt Lake City Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_843" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h5>Botox Timing</h5><p>The effects from your Botox treatment should be visible for 3-4 months. This will vary depending on your own metabolism, the area injected, and the amount initially injected. (Asif Pirani, MD, FRCS(C), Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Typically Botox lasts 3-4 months. Men and some women have very strong corrugator muscles between the eyes may require more Botox and once effective may last longer. After a routine has been established with Botox the duration is usually a little longer.</p><p>The onset may be quicker after a routine Botox injection schedule has been set up. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The general rule of thumb is that Botox lasts approximately three months. There a several variables included in that determination. The patients age, the extent of the deepness of lines, etc. (Jeffrey Adelglass, MD, Dallas Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is a wonderful FDA approved material that has a long history of successful results. Botox generally lasts four months on average, and can be injected again when it wears off. There can be some variability from physician to physician so be sure to consult with an experienced injector before making any decisions. (Andrew Miller, MD, Edison Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>The effects of botox usuallys last 3-6 months</i></p><p>I generally tell patients that Botox Cosmetic lasts 3 to 6 months with the average length of duration close to 4 months. Botox works by targeting the signal between the nerve and the muscle. As this signal is reformed by the body, the muscle action gradually returns and the lines and wrinkles begin to reappear.</p><p>Research has shown that the most important factor to determine duration of treatment is to match the strength of muscle contraction with correct number of Botox units used. (Miriam Hanson, MD, Austin Dermatologist)</p><p><b>The effect of botox last 3+ months</b></p><p>As a rough guide, Botox lasts 3-4 months for the first time. The duration depends on the location and the amount of units injected. The duration also varies among individuals. Remember, also, that Botox wears off gradually. It may take 1-2 months between the time you start to notice Botox wearing off and the time that you have regained full use of the treated muscles.
