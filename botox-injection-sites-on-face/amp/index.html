– Forehead<br>
– Crows feet<br>
– Bunny lines at the root of the nose<br>
– Carefully in the fine wrinkles about the mouth In the superficial muscle of the neck (platysma) to reduce up and down neck wrinkles<br>
– And less frequently to decrease the size of the Masseter muscle in a broad face. (Nathan Mayl, MD (retired), Fort Lauderdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox is approved for forehead lines, but has many other uses</h5><p>The crow’s feet area respond well to botox. Also neck muscle lines (platysma) are sometimes treated.

</div><p>Non cosmetic uses can include reduction of armpit sweating, and minimize onset of migraines.

Take care to select a experienced dermatologist. (Robert Kasten, MD, Mainz Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox – where to inject</strong></p><p>You should definitely talk to whomever you go to about this – they will need to do a complete evaluation of your whole face to see where BOTOX will help your wrinkles, or where you may need something more invasive like surgery.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1931" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>BOTOX is only FDA approved for treatment in the glabella (the 11) but it is routinely used off label in the forehead, crows feet, and bunny lines. (Catherine Huang-Begovic, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox is best suited for the muscles in the upper third of the face.</em></p><p>Botox works best on the wrinkles caused by the muscles that make you frown, squint, etc. It is an excellent non-surgical option for the wrinkles of the forehead, around the eyes (crows feet), and in between the eyebrows (glabella). (Peter Schmid, DO, FAACS, Longmont Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I commonly use Botox or Dysport to treat: forehead lines brow furrows crows feet neck bands droopy lips lip wrinkles. (Jose M.

</div><p>Botox works best on dynamic wrinkle lines. In other words, wrinkles that are caused by muscle movement. The most common sites are the forehead, the frown area, and crows feet. Other areas are for bunny lines when you scrunch your nose, small amounts to the lines around your mouth when your purse your lips, and to the edges of your chin which pull your smile down.</p><p>Some of these sites must be done by an experienced practitioner since they are advanced techniques. If your lines are at rest, Botox will help but you may need a filler for the crease at rest or a laser resurfacing procedure. (Grace Liu, MD, Newport Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox® around the eyes</h3><p>Botox is usued most often for the frown lines between the eyes, crows’ feet lines, and forehead lines.

</div><p><strong>Botox for facial wrinkles</strong></p><p>BOTOX® can safely be used between the brows to eliminate frown lines, in the forehead to treat horizontal forehead lines, in the eye area to lift eyebrows, around the eyes to soften crows feet, in the lip area to minimize smokers lines and can also add fullness to lips and turn up the corners of the mouth.</p><p>BOTOX® can also be used in the neck area to treat neck bands and tighten jaw line area, and the nose to eliminate tip depression. Botox is wonderful but it is not the answer to all aging concerns.</p><p>Fillers like Juvederm help to fill in lines and wrinkles in the lower face and laser skin rejuvenation (many lasers are available that require no down time) can also be effective. A good place to start is a consultation at a plastic surgery office or plastic surgery medical spa that offers a full array of aesthetic procedures so you can learn about options that might be best for you.

</div><p><b>Areas of the face most suited for Botox injections </b></p><p>While most muscles of the face could theoretically be injected with Botox, the results in some areas may be worse than the wrinkles. An example of this might be indiscriminate use around the mouth which might give the appearance of a stroke victim.</p><p>The only area for Botox injections which is FDA approved is between the brows in the region called the glabella. However, very common treatment areas of the face, in addition to the glabella, is the forehead and the area between the eyelids and the temple (called crows feet). (Roger J. Oldham, MD, Bethesda Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Facial botox</em></p><p>Botox is typically used in the upper face whereas fillers are used in the lower face:nasolabial lines.

</div><p>Sometimes you need to add a filler to this area as well. (Joanne Lopes, MD, Virginia Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox for facial lines and wrinkles</i></p><p>Botox is used in the upper, mid and lower face regions. The only area that it is FDA approved to be used is between the eyes in the frown area called the glabella. All other areas, although they have been well documented in our journals are called “off-label.”</p><p>Common areas treated include the forehead, glabella, crows feet around the eyes, bunny lines on the nose, around the mouth for lip lines, in the jawline for downturned mouth, in the chin for chin dimpling, in the neck for neck bands and then along the side of the nose to treat the “gummy smile.”</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1936" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

I also, depending on the patient will treat with very, very small amounts around the mouth.</p><p>Some women, when focusing on something will pull the corners of the mouth down slightly and that can be treated with botox. Also, some women complain of the fine lines on the upper lip (“kissing lines”) and they can be softened with a little botox.</p><p>Problems that patients have with over aggressive treatment of the mouth: feeling like they have trouble spitting (after brushing teeth for example) as well as feeling “weird” when drinking through a straw. Generally, my patients are very happy with minimal treatment around the mouth, especially when they get used to it. (Thomas B.

</div><h5>Treating wrinkles with Botox</h5><p>Botox works by weakening the facial muscles of expression. When a specific muscle causes a wrinkle than treating that muscle will make that wrinkle dissipate. Some facial wrinkles are not caused the excess muscle movement, those creases can not be treated with Botox, but they might respond to treatment with a filler.</p><p>The most common sites of treatment with Botox is frown lines, smile lines and forehead lines. In addition Botox can be used to treat some lip lines when used in combination with a filler, as well as some wrinkling of the chin. (Boris M. Ackerman, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox or Dysport for dynamic wrinkles</strong></p><p>Both Botox and Dysport are FDA approved medical grade botulinum toxins that work by relaxing facial muscles that tend to be contracted involuntarily on forehead and crows feet sites. In the hands of an experienced board certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon, Botox or Dysport can be used to raise eyebrows, minimize bunny lines on nose, lift corners of mouth, reduce masseter muscles to sharpen facial contours along lower half of the face, reduce sweating among other more advanced treatment sites and indication.

</div><p><strong>Areas treated with Botox</strong></p><p>Botox is usually best suited for treating forehead lines and the crows foot area. As a general rule, fillers with hyaluronic acid work best around the mouth area. (Deason Dunagan, MD, Huntsville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Upper face best for botox, lower face for fillers</i></p><p>Botox, like Dysport, works for wrinkles caused by hyperactive muscles such as crow’s feet, the vertical lines between the eyebrows, and the horizontal lines on the forehead. There are some uses for it in the lower face but these are not as common.</p><p>Most of the wrinkles in the lower face are best helped by dermal fillers such as Restylane or Juvederm. And of course sometimes a peel with laser or TCA is the way to go. (Richard Baxter, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox for the face</b></p><p>Botox is safe to use in many sites of the face but it will not get rid of all wrinkles. Common areas of treatment are the forehead lines, the mid-glabella lines (11 lines), and crow’s feet.</p><p>I have used it on platysma bands in the neck, fine lip lines, high nasolabial lines, and for hypertrophic masseter muscles on the side of the jaw. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Areas for injecting BOTOX</strong></p><p>BOTOX can be injected in many sites of the face for great and safe results. The most common area treated is the frown complex, but the horizontal forehead lines and lines around the eyes (“Crows feet”) are commonly treated too.</p><p>Less commonly, the corners of the mouth can be injected, as well as smoker’s lines around the lips, a dimpled chin, or bunny lines on the nose. Even the neck and jawline (“Nefertiti lift”) can be treated. (Benjamin Barankin, MD, FRCPC, Toronto Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Where does Botox work on the face?</h3><p>Botox is only FDA approved for injection between the eyes (the “11” lines). But it is fairly standard for it to be injected in the following sites:</p><ol>
<li>Between the eyes</li>
<li>Crow’s feet at outside of eyes</li>
<li>Forehead</li>
<li>Upper lip</li>
</ol><p>There may be other areas of the face and neck that are injected at other practices, but we stick to these sites. (Harold J. Kaplan, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Facial sites where Botox is best suited, safe or effective</strong></p><p>Botox acts by causing paralysis of the area of the muscle into which it has been injected. It therefore can smooth lines caused by hyperactive facial muscles. Botox beautifully smooths the Crows’ feet lines at the outer corner of the eyes, forehead lines, base of the nose “11 lines” and Bunny Lines and lip lines.</p><p>It can ALSO be used to lift your brows and droopy downward pointing corners of the mouth and drop on overly lifted, gum showing upper lip. It can reduce dimpling of the chin. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox indications</i></p><p>If you have wrinkles across your entire face, Botox may only be able to partially help you. Botox only works for dynamic wrinkles, those lines cause by overactive facial contractions, such as crow’s feet near eyes, frown lines in between eyes (above nose) and horizontal forehead lines.</p><p>If you loose skin with fine lines and wrinkles, then you may require a surgical procedure such as a facelift or perhaps laser resurfacing/chemical peel, combined with Botox. Please consult with a board certified plastic surgeon to thoroughly evaluate your face and recommend a plan for facial rejuvenation, that may or may not, include Botox. (William Bruno, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Sites for Botox Treatment</em></p><p>The three most common sites treated with Botox are the: glabella, forehead, and crows feet area. The glabella is the area between the eyebrows and often called the “11” sign made by 2 vertical lines in that area.</p><p>Some other physicians also treat with Botox to other areas on the face and neck.
