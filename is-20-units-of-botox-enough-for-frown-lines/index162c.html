<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>This seems a very reasonable dosage. On average expect 20-30 units of botox to improved the frown or 11’s.</p><p>The most important bit of advice is to have a degree of patience too. The product kicks in with maximum result at the 2 week point. (Rupert Critchley, MD, MRCGP, London Physician)</p><p>You will not notice any effect immediately after Botox (contrast this with fillers, the effect of which is immediate!). </p><p>Wait three days to notice any results and wait 14 days to appreciate full effect.</p><p>If you are not satisfied with the results after two weeks, return to your doctor for a reevaluation.

</div>If you need more immediate results, consider Dysport, a cousin of Botox which produces results within a day or two. (Joseph A. Eviatar, MD, FACS, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)
<p>The number of Botox units required to treat the glabellar vertical lines or “11’s” can vary depending on the patient, whether and how often they have been treated in the past. In my practice I tend to think of the glabella and forehead as one area.</p><p>I use about 25 units to treat this area to soften the vertical 11’s and central horizontal forehead lines. I understand that every patient’s body is different in its response to neuromodulators and their ability to metabolize them.</p><p>Sometimes patients require more and some patients don’t need as much. As I get to know my patients better in their follow up appointments, I am able to adjust the dosage as needed.

</div><p>The frown lines are created a by a group six muscles. The muscle mass and strength of these muscles is different from one individual to the next. I had patients in whom I only used 15 units and others in whom I had to use 25 units. It is not advisable to over treat because of potential complications, and under treating will not give you the results you desire. If you only had the treatment a day before you will need to wait a while longer (7-10 days in most cases ),to see the full results from the treatment.</p><p>The lack of result may be just due to the short time elapsed from the delivery of the treatment and not insufficient dose. In case you continue to see the same frown lines after 10 days you should go back for a follow up.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1378" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The doctor will most probably revalute and if he thinks necessary he will retreat. (Anca Tchelebi-Moscatello, MD, Mount Kisco Hair Restoration Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox for 11 lines</h4><p>In my experience, 20 units for the area between the brows, the glabellar region, where the muscles that make the “11 lines” are, is reasonable and about average. </p><p>Depending on several factors, including anatomy and desired outcome, I have had to use as little as 14 units in that area and as many as 26 units.</p><p>Also, it usually takes between 4 and 7 days to notice the effects of Botox, and since it has only been one day, it is really too early to tell what the final effect is going to be. (Billy Ledbetter, MD, Austin Physician)</p><p>20 units of Botox is a fairly typical dose for most patients but as the muscle mass increases larger doses will be needed. Many providers will offer a free touch-up for first time patients so that an effective dose can be achieved.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1379" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>This avoids an unhappy patient. Dysport is an alternative neuromodulator to Botox and results are usually seen 1-2 days sooner than Botox. Both products have a typical duration of 3 to 4 months. (Richard E. Moore, MD, Saint Louis Physician)</p><p>If 20 units has not given you satisfactory results then you would need to use a filler to get rid of the number 11’s. Most of the time it’s difficult to predict how many units are adequate.</p><p>Until the units are injected and reassesed. (Mahalingam Satchi, MD, Danbury OB/GYN)</p><p>Depending on how many times you have had toxin in the past and the amount of muscle, in this case the corrugators, the dosage can vary person by person. (Benjamin Caughlin, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>First and foremost Botox might take at least a few days to a week before you see a significant effect. The amount of Botox required for any given area (11’s for example) varies quite a bit from one patient to another.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1380" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>20 to 25 units is very much within the norm. But the potential for improvement also depends on how deep the lines are and how long they’ve been there. Newer creases respond better than old established creases.</p><p>In most cases, Botox (or Dysport) will give significant improvement. (Richard L. Zeff, MD, Portsmouth Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I tell my patients that you can’t expect immediate results from Botox – it can take between 3 and 14 days to show the full effects. If after two weeks, you aren’t happy with your results, you should definitely call your doctor and ask about it.</p><p>20 units of Botox is a fairly standard dosage for the 11s. (Jason Brett Lichten, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox to the glabella</em></p><p>20 units of Botox to the glabella area is a common starting dose. Some patients, particularly men, will require more than 20 units in this area to get the results they are looking for. Regular follow up with a well-trained and experienced injector is important as this will allow results to be tailored for each individual patient.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1381" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Patients should be reminded that Botox typically takes 3-4 days to begin to show results, and 7-10 days to reach maximum efficacy. (Matthew Richardson, MD, Frisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most people will use 20-30 units for the frown lines between the brows. It does take a week or so for the BOTOX to “kick in” and for you to see the effects. I think you might want to give it a few days. (Janet Turkle, MD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The average dosing for just treatment of frown lines between the eyebrows often referred to as the 11’s is 15-25 units for females. Males often require addtional units. (Kathleen Morno, MD, Highland Park Physician)</p><p>Firstly, you need to wait at least 3 days for Botox to start working, and 2 weeks for it to have its maximal effect. It is normal to have no movement the day following injection. The frown lines (or 11’s) are located between the eye brows and are created by the action of the paired corrugator supercilii muscles located on either side.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1382" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>When injecting this area, the procerus muscle, which is located in the center and causes horizontal lines in this area, is also typically injected. This entire area is referred to as the “glabella”. Depending of the patient, the glabella generally requires 10-30 units of Botox, with an average of 20 units, distributed throughout these muscles.</p><p>Men generally require larger amounts of Botox, as they have bigger muscles in this area. (Jonathan Cabin, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox Takes Some Time</h5><p>Generally it takes 3-4 days for Botox to begin working and can usually take between 10-14 days to see the full effects. Since it’s very early on, you will see more improvement in the upcoming days.</p><p>For the glabella region (11s or frown lines) 20 -30 units of Botox is a reasonable amount. Finding an injector that you feel comfortable with is an important thing. You must also remember that is does take time for the effects of Botox to be fully realized.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1383" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The results are not immediate, so patience is important. Botox only lasts for a period of 3-4 months. It is unlikely that your injection is trying to cheat you since he wants you to come back for future treatments. (Robert W. Sheffield, MD, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Injecting 20-30 units depending on the severity of the frown lines is within the average range and should yield an effect. (Mahsa Sohrab, MD, New Haven Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>The Botox doesn’t kick in for a couple of days, sometimes not completely for 2 weeks. Everyone’s forehead and frown is a little bit different. Some of us need more Botox than others, as some of us “recruit” different muscles to exert a “full frown”.</p><p>As to the question of how many average units, about 25 plus or minus. You might get a better result though, by treating the forehead lines and around your eyes to make the effect look better.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1384" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Costs vary with the number of units, which neuortoxin was used, and whether the consultation was part of the first treatment costs. In my area (northern CA) $256 would be a relatively lower price for treating this area… (Bruce Saal, MD, Los Gatos Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Start to work from 2 to 4 day and in 3 weeks for final result . Botox last between 6 to 8 months all depends on the brand. The price range is 200 to 350euros. (Bulent Cihantimur, MD, Turkey Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Proper Dosage for the “11’s”</h5><p>20 units of Botox for the “11’s” is the minimum standard dose. The Botox effect, if it is Botulinum Toxin Type A, the label Botox, should take effect between one and seven days with a maximum effect at a couple of weeks.</p><p>Other versions of neuro toxin, which have different names, will have different times of onset, which means how long it takes for them to work, so you need to be very clear about what you actually receive.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1385" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Some doctor’s offices will call is Botox so everyone knows what they are talking about, but it may not be the brand Botox and the different types are different molecules and are with different behavioral characteristics.</p><p>Finally, I think that 24 units is a better dose for most “11’s”, as it will help people who need a little more than the standard dose. Heavy, strong frown lines and particularly men as well need 24 units in my opinion. (Richard A. D’Amico, MD, FACS, Englewood Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The number of units to effectively treat frown lines is different for each patient. The degree of their fine lines, wrinkles and aesthetic goals all play a part in the equation. It is premature to evaluate the results of your Botox treatment at this time.</p><p>It takes approximately 3 to 5 days post treatment to begin to see visible results with a peak effect at 2 weeks out. I generally use 20-30 units to treat the glabella or frown lines. </p><p>In some cases patients may require hyaluronic acid filler to fill in a permanent crease remains after relaxing the muscles. (Pooja Malik, MD, Cherry Hill Family Physician)</p><p>The number of units of Botox needed to relax the”11″ lines/ frown lines depends on the amount of muscle present in the area. If there is a lot of thick, dense muscle then more Botox will be needed.</p><p>In general men have more muscle mass than women and will require more Botox. Women require an average of 18-28 of Botox to treat the “11” lines/ frown lines and men may need significantly more 22-35 units.</p><p>The onset of action depends upon the type of botulinum toxin used – Botox may start to work after a few days but can take up to two weeks for the full effect. Dysport tends to work very quickly with the full effect seen three days after infection.</p><p>Other forms of botulinum toxin suggest as Xeomin and Myobloc tend to have a time to onset of action similar to Botox. (Sharon Scherl, MD, Englewood Dermatologist)</p><p>I always tell my patients that it takes about three to four days to begin to see a result from a Botox or Xeomin treatment. The treatment effects will max out in about 10 days and I invite all of my patients to come in at ten days so we can evaluate the effects.</p><p>If they need a few additional units I usually provide them at no cost. Twenty units is usually a sufficient amount but if the vertical frown lines are deep it often takes a wrinkle filler such as Restylane to make them go away.</p><p>Using a wrinkle filler and Botox or Xeomin extends the life of the wrinkle filler. (Richard Foxx, MD, Poway Physician)</p><p>Botox can take up to 2 weeks to take full effect, therefore don’t anticipate seeing visible results in less than 24 hours. The amount of product injected to improve the appearance of the frown lines will vary from patient to patient, as every person’s facial anatomy and dynamic movement is unique. (Vu Ho, MD, Plano Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Typically 20 – 30 units</h3><p>The average amount used for the “11’s” or frown lines is typically 20-30 units, and can vary significantly depending on individual muslce anatomy and activity. Technique and injector experience also matters greatly because the placement and volume of the injection will impact the result and duration.</p><p>If this was your first treatment, the doctor may have wanted to stay on the conservative side to see how much of an effect you obtain and then inject more if needed because there is also a risk of dropping the brow area if too much effect is experienced.</p><p>It is also important to realize that Botox and other neuromodulators (Dysport and Xeomin) can only inhibit muscle movement so if you have fixed or deep ’11’ lines at rest, then a injectable filler such as Juvederm or Restylane may be needed if you want to reduce the furrow more completely. (Frank Barone, MD, Toledo Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>20 units sounds reasonable. Every person is different. There are some women I might only do 15 units on, and some men I might do 40 Units on.
