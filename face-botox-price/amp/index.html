<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The price of face Botox varies widely, but is usually somewhere between $8 (on a good special) to $12 (without discounts) per unit. The price varies widely and can often be seen advertised lower than the prices I mentioned; however, although the injections are simple to perform.</p><p>Knowing how to perform them properly can only come through an intricate and detailed knowledge of the anatomy of the face and the skin.</p><p>I would recommend that you only have Botox injected by a dermatologist or surgeon. (P. Daniel Ward, MD, Salt Lake City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of face Botox depends on the location of the Doctor and or RN-Injector. It is also priced usually by area and or amount used.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1734" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Botox can be used in many different areas of the face including the neck. (Norman M. Rowe, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of Botox typically depends on the amount of Botox that is being injected. The cost for 30 units is often around $380. This would be a low dose for the forehead, crow’s feet and glabella area.</p><p>Fifty units of Botox can often treat the upper third of the face and usually cost around $550. (Jonathan Crane, DO, Wilmington Dermatologist)</p><p><i>Prices of Botox vary from area and amount used</i></p><p>When you are getting Botox one of the most important considerations is the skill of the injector. I have found over the years many patients had Botox done once by someone inexperienced and the patients have told me they “hated it”.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1735" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>After they let me do it they saw a huge difference. You want your Botox to look natural and not artificial and that is an art that takes years of injecting to get perfected. That being said many doctors dilute the Botox or put in small amounts to give the lowest prices.</p><p>There is also a subset of injectors that are injecting products that are not true Botox which is misleading as well. Face Botox prices can vary as well based on the area and the amount used to treat the patient.</p><p>Buyer beware because if it sounds too good to be true it usually is. Find an experienced board certified dermatologist for your treatment. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p><b>Anti Wrinkle costs</b></p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1736" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In our practice we charge by the unit. Our cost is $18 per unit, but we offer a discount for Patients who sign on to our VIP package which provides a significant reduction in cost and protects against any price increases.</p><p>As for regions, typically the Glabella would cost around $360 and Crows feet $216. (Richard Bloom, MBBS (Hons), FRACS, Melbourne Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox By The Area</strong></p><p>At my practice, Cape Fear Aesthetics, we charge by the area: $275 for 1 area, $475 for 2 areas, and $675 for 3 areas. We want to provide our clients with the best outcome, so no matter the amount of units someone may need, we charge the same.</p><p>Additionally, we do a 10 day follow up at which time if there is a need for a touch up of Botox we will do so at our own cost.

</div><p>Botox averages $10-$12 per unit in the Cincinnati area. So a typical crows feet application should be 25 units or $250-$300. Cost is all based on total number of units used and we all pay the same amount for a bottle of botox.</p><p>So be careful when somebody advertises very low botox rates. They are either losing money or diluting the botox down and you are getting less units then promised. (Kurtis Martin, MD, Cincinnati Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The two most common ways to charge for BoTox are by the “area” or by the “unit”. I charge by the unit, as each person will require a different amount in each different area. Costs may vary in your geographic location as well as who is the one administering the BoTox (physician, nurse, aesthetician, etc.), but a range in cost from $8-16/unit is reasonable, with $10-12/unit on average. (Lewis Albert Andres, MD, Scottsdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1738" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h5>New products may bring botox price down</h5><p>As new similar products compete with botox, the price of the botox may well diminish.(We can always hope). The physician’s time and skill and other factors also build into the cost. We try to keep botox affordable and charge $10 per unit.</p><p>Depending of what lines the personwishes to be diminished, it can usually be done with 15 to 30 units. (Christopher J. Peers, MD, South Bend Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Finding the right place for botox</strong></p><p>Botox is currently being offered practically on every corner. There are chiropractors, dentists and even podiatrists that are offering Botox. There are several things that you need to consider prior to making a decision on where you go.</p><p>You want to find out the most reasonable price, but you also want the most qualified physician. Some physicians dilute their Botox more than others, which will result in a less than desirable outcome. A reputable practice is of the utmost importance.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1739" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Most place charge. Per unit which is fine, but most people do not know how many units it will take to get the best results. We charge $199 per area up to 25 units, and if 10 days later you are not happy with the results, we do a complimentary touch up.</p><p>There a places that may charge less, but if it is results you want, it is experience you need. (Jeffrey Adelglass, MD, Dallas Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox cost, Botox Price in Spokane</h3><p>Face Botox is generally charged $12-14 per unit at all the area locations. The more areas that are treated the higher the cost. In general between the eyes takes 20-30 units, the forehead takes another 20-40 units and the crow’s feet takes 6-12 units per side.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1740" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-2240a3b88f35be89b5b951ceaf8d3b67">

</div><p>More Botox is needed in people who have never had it or have very strong facial muscles while less is needed for repeat Botox users. We charge less during our Botox events and have discounts for patients who provide us with new patients.</p><p>At our practice a board certified plastic surgeon is the only person who injects our patients. (Chad K. Wheeler, MD, Spokane Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Some people charge by area, and others by the amount of Botox units used. I charge $14/unit. for Botox, as everyone requires a different amount depending on their muscles and degree of wrinkling. (Lana Long, MD, Cincinnati Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>The cost of Botox varies</h5><p>The cost of face Botox varies based on three things:</p><ol>
<li>The amount you receive. The doctor will evaluate the lines you want addressed in the context of your face and how your face moves. You and the doctor will decide which areas you want to treat. Some people have visibly stronger muscles than others and will require higher amounts of Botox. People with deeper lines may require more Botox than someone with fewer and lighter lines.</li>
<li>If the charge is by area or by unit. Some doctors charge by area treated. This means that if you treat your crow’s feet that is one area. The area between your eyebrows would be a second area. The forehead is a third area. Other doctors charge by unit given, which is what I do. That way you are only paying for exactly what you receive.</li>
<li>Where you live. The cost of Botox is higher in major metropolitan areas like New York and Los Angeles. The cost can range anywhere from $300 to $1000 depending on these factors. Be sure to always receive your treatments from a board certified Dermatologist or Plastic Surgeon. It’s not a good idea to receive these treatments at a “Botox party” in someone’s home. And if the price seems too good to be true, it probably is too good to be true, so do a little more research. (Jordana S. Gilman, MD, Washington Dermatologic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><p>Cost depends on where you live and who is injecting the product. I always tell my patients that the “WHO” does matter, or, it is not always the injectable that gives you the great results, but rather the INJECTOR, (who is injecting the product)! I see that physician injectors may cost more than non-physicians.</p><p>I am a surgeon and not only perform injections (botulinum toxin, fillers, etc.) but also perform invasive surgery. I feel because of my daily exposure to the muscles and nerves of the face (which I see at the time of face-lifts and nose surgery as well as cancer removal surgery) that I know exactly where and at what depth injections need to be at to be perfect.</p><p>Because of this, I feel confident that my injection technique is sound, accurate and delivers awesome results. As such, I might charge a little more than a non-physician or a non-surgeon. I have seen ranges in my area, charged by the unit injected, between $9-$16 per unit.
