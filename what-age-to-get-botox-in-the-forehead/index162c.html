<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>No matter what your age, Botox is a great way to reduce muscle function that causes facial wrinkles.</p><p>If the muscles continue and increase, the wrinkles produced by those muscles become etched in the skin and permanent, thus visible all the time, not just when the muscle is active.</p><p>By blocking the muscle function, you also block production of the wrinkles.</p><p>Another thing that helps is regular use of tretinoin (Retin-A) that stimulates collagen production, making the support layer of the skin thicker where it can resist formation of permanent wrinkles. (Robert T. Buchanan, MD, Highlands Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is difficult to define any age for getting BOTOX injections. If you have or you feel you are developing forehead lines then small units of BOTOX can definitely be used to refine you’re your forehead and to get rid of those lines.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3996" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>So, we think there is no particular age when to start with BOTOX. (Amit Gupta, MD, India Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is not the age that determines when to get Botox but the appearance of the problem you want to correct. Understand that Botox only helps dynamic wrinkles so that if they are static there is little if any improvement.</p><p>Be sure you see a board certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon. (Melvin Elson, MD, Nashville Dermatologist)</p><p>Botox is not about age it is about what makes you happy. I would strongly advise you against getting botox directly in the forehead. This freezes the muscle that make the lines. However it also freezes your forehead. (Kenneth D. Steinsapir, MD, Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox or Dysport weakens the muscles that are treated and changes the way you animate. Fine wrinkles are related to age but are accentuated by sun damage, smoking and other lifestyle decisions.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3997" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Botox costs vary on the areas treated ranging from $265 – $675. Discuss your concerns with your plastic surgeon to develop a realistic approach to your questions. (James McDonough, MD, Asheville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox can be used at any age if indicated by a sound understanding of what is causing the wrinkles.</h3><p>Many young patients start wrinkling their forehead because of genetically baggy eyelids. Patients hold up their baggy eyelids with their forehead causing forehead wrinkles at an early age. I cannot see you eyelids in the photos you have posted.</p><p>If your eyelids are quite baggy, you may eventually benefit from a blepharoplasty. If you have heavy eyelids, using Botox on the forehead may make your eyelids feel heavy. If your eyelids are not heavy, then Botox to stop you from creating expression lines in your forehead is perfectly safe at your age. (Mark Taylor, MD, Salt Lake City Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3998" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>More people are starting Botox treatment earlier, so they can slow the development of facial wrinkling. Prices vary, but are typically anywhere from $9-14 per unit. Focus on the experience of your injector so that you can get a result that makes you happy. (Austin Hayes, MD, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>If you have dynamic wrinkles, regardless of your age, Botox is a great drug. I wouldn’t hesitate to treat you. (Jeffrey Swetnam, MD, Fayetteville General Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox in Younger patients</strong></p><p>Botox is safe in younger population, the youngest patient I have treated with Botox for cosmetic reasons was 22 years old. If you already started seen lines in the forehead it is a good idea to start using Botox to prevent the progression of the lines.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3999" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Once the lines becomes static, meaning you can see them at rest , Botox may not be able to provide a full correction. (Mara De La Vega, MD, Lake Mary Family Physician)</p><p><i>Botox and Age</i></p><p>Botox is a great treatment option for lines that are present when your forehead is at rest and you are not lifting your brows. You do not need much and it should be spread across your forehead to avoid a different brow shape developing. (Brian Windle, MD, Kirkland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Avoid dose dependent “freezing” of your forehead. You would definitely benefit from “micro” doses that will allow you to maintain your expressions.</p><p>The only “negative” aspect of this technique is much higher number of injection points. Depending on the area and desired effect each injection point receives between 1/4 to 1/8 unit.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4000" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>This method, known also as “meso-Botox”, was first described in late 90’s by French physician. (Marek Kacki, MD, Nashville Internist)</p><h3>When to begin Botox</h3><p>It is not too early to begin Botox treatments in your 20’s. It is good for preventative measures. Other things to consider are using medical grade skin care products and sunscreen every day. I recommend you visit with a board certified plastic surgeon in your area to learn more about Botox and other helpful treatments to optimize your skin. (Camille Cash, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Patients tend to start off conservatively and as they age, they may use more. In addition to prevention, some younger patients like to use botox for jaw reduction to get a v-shaped face, and for other reasons like lifting the brows or hyperhidrosis.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4001" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Given your age, it might be a little early but it is still reasonable, and whatever you do make sure to start conservatively! (Chase Lay, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>A lot of my patients start at around 25 years old to prevent lines from forming.</p><p>Botox in Montreal ranges between $12- $15 per unit. A consultation will be necessary to determine exact dosage. (Omar Fouda Neel, MD, FRCSC, FACS, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is a great treatment for relaxing/softening lines in the forehead. To have a proper outcome please see an experienced injector to prepare and treat your concerns. Botox is an excellent treatment in your 20’s to help prevent deeper wrinkles. (Farhan Taghizadeh, MD, Phoenix Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Preventative botox for preventing wrinkles from progressing further and reducing them is an excellent idea in your age group. (Sachit Shah, MD, Surrey Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4002" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><strong>Botox for Forehead Wrinkles</strong></p><p>Botox is an excellent treatment modality for softening of forehead wrinkles whether it be in your 20’s or 60’s. Please see an expert injector for best results. (Praven Chetty, MD, Kelowna Physician)</p><p>At your age, I say to patients that Botox is preventative rather than reactive. By getting Botox injections in your 20’s you are preventing deep etched lines that will form when you are older. (Steven Swengel, MD, Los Gatos Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>The good news about starting relatively young is that you don’t need much Botox and that it will prevent lines from getting deeper. The price varies quite a bit, depending on the practitioner and location, but I would estimate a minimum of $150.</p><p>Of course you’ll want to get an in-person consultation, so your provider will be able to give you an exact quote at that time. (David W. Kim, MD, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4003" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p><strong>Botox for Younger Patients</strong></p><p>Personally, I prefer to start Botox treatments in younger patients as a preventative measure – I myself started getting Botox when I was 26 years old. Botox works by temporarily reducing movement in overactive muscles to prevent creasing of the skin.</p><p>If you start early, before you have any etched-in lines, you can prevent the formation of deeper wrinkles. The results of Botox typically last approximately 3-4 months. The price typically vary depending on the amount of Botox used, the experience and qualifications of your injector, and the location of the clinic.</p><p>I would recommend scheduling a consultation with a cosmetic dermatologist or plastic surgeon to discuss your goals and come up with the best treatment plan for you. (Faiyaaz Kalimullah, MD, FAAD, Chicago Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>We’ve had patients your age come in for Botox before, this type of early-on skincare is not uncommon, so no, you are not too young! It looks like the are you are specifying could benefit from and injectable.</p><p>I would setup a consultation with an injector in your area to see what would work best for you, as well as to get accurate pricing!. (Jeffrey R. Raval, MD, FACS, MBA, Denver Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Genetics, lifestyle, sun exposure, age, gravity, expressiveness all will play a role in the development of lines and wrinkles thus ones age is not really the deciding factor of when to use or not use Botox to treat or prevent these.</p><p>It does appear you would benefit from a small amount of Botox to the area of your concern. Price will vary from city to city and state to state. Keep in mind that a good combination approach to these fine lines and wrinkles using Botox to stop the muscle action causing them along with a good ongoing skin care regimen, sun block as well as collagen building therapies such as microneedle/PRP, lasers, chemical peels will help keep the youthful and fresh look.</p><p>Seek consultation with a qualified physician and medical esthetician to fully assess your concerns. (Paul Pietro, MD, Greenville Physician)</p><p>As we grow older, the lines can become deeper and etched. The use of Botox will prevent this from happening. Prices will vary based on geography, the amount of Botox used and the practice. You might expect to pay $150-400 to treat your horizontal forehead lines with Botox.</p><p>Beautiful and natural results can be achieved. Please be sure to see an expert injector for an in-person consultation to fully discuss your concerns and your goals and expectations in order to determine the best treatment plan. (Christian N. Ford, M.D., Boston Physician)</p><p>We all develop this line secondary to the activation of the forehead muscles. It is fine to be seen and examined by a qualified injector like a Plastic Surgeon. The price will range widely base on specials from $8-16 depending on who is doing your injections. (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
