<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><em>Who can administer Botox?</em></p><p>The fact is ANYONE can administer Botox who is properly trained, and understands how the medication can be properly and safely provided. </p><p>This means that a doctor can do this, as well as nurse who is under the careful supervision of the doctor.</p><p>The doctor should always be very transparent about their training, the medicine himself, and all facets of the procedure. </p><p>Should this always be a plastic surgeon? By no means, of course, but as a general rule, you will find that plastic surgeons, by and large, have the necessary training to provide excellent results.</p><p>More importantly, they can take you the next level of service, which many providers of Botox can not. That is, you can have a discussion with a plastic surgeon about other methods of facial rejuvenation because they can actually provide you that service most of the time.<br>

</div>I think that is the most important difference. Of course, ENT doctors who also perform cosmetic surgery can provide a similar variety of services and options. (Srdjan Ostric, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)
<p>State laws vary state to state on who can administer botox. The important thing to remember is who should be injecting your botox? It’s your face, you should want the most qualified person for the job.</p><p>Personally I would refrain from “med” type spas who are usually under the supervision of a M. D that rarely visits the location.</p><p>In my practice I am the only one who injects, being a Surgeon who specializes in facial plastics, its important to have a welth of knowledge on facial muscles and aesthetic. (Hannah Vargas, MD, Kansas City Facial Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<em>Requirements for injecting BOTOX</em><p>Currently there is a free for all as far as who is injecting BOTOX. There are specialists with extensive training like dermatologists and plastic surgeons injecting, then there are other doctors (e.g. ENT, ophthalmologists, general practitioners, OB/Gynes, Internists), nurses, and even dentists.</p><p>Since we’re talking about treating your face, we want to have great, natural looking results with optimal safety — my biased opinion would be to go with a specialist such as a dermatologist or plastic surgeon who has extensive anatomical knowledge and knowledge of beauty and proper proportions. (Benjamin Barankin, MD, FRCPC, Toronto Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox and MD requirements</em></p><p>I would choose doctors who are board certified in plastic surgery, ear nose and throat, ophthalmology or dermatology. Avoid doctors who are board certified in other specialties that have no cosmetic component. In some practices, nurses will give botox injections and this is acceptable if properly trained. (Kurtis Martin, MD, Cincinnati Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<b>Stick to the MDs for Botox</b><p>Best people who are qualified are those who know what they’re injecting. Dermatologists, ophthalmologists and plastic surgeons are the ones who use it the most and know the underlying anatomy. It is always a safe bet to have them perform the injections for you.</p><p>I would steer away from non-MD injectors. It is always better to pay that extra price and have it done right rather than live the effects of the material for 3-4 months till its gone. (Hassan Galadari, MD, Dubai Dermatologist)</p><p><b>Qualified injector for botox</b></p><p>While any doctor holding a medical license, such as family doctors, gynecologists and even dentists can go to weekend courses and then start to inject Botox, choosing them may give you an adverse or poor result.<br>

</div>To obtain the best possible result, you should choose an experienced injector- such as a plastic surgeon who is certified and who has years of experience and specializes in using neuromodulators like Botox and Xeomin. (Steven Yarinsky, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)
<p><strong>Who is qualified to inject botox</strong></p><p>There are specialized practitioners in several disciplines who engage in the administration of botulinum toxin to reduce wrinkling of the forehead. The most important qualities, in my opinion, are that the practitioner is a liscenced physician with specific and focused training in facial anatomy, is well versed in the indications and risks and benefits of these products and has significant experience in their administration.</p><p>A clean comofrtable office is obviously important in that the clinician is devoted to cleanliness and your comfort. An important attribute of the clinician is that they have provided clinical services for some time in their geographic location.<br>

</div>I would make an effort to reserach the reputation of the injector and not just weigh on the fact that the office may be located in an upscale part of town. (Michael A. Carron, MD, Detroit Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<p><b>Who is Qualified to Inject Botox</b></p><p>Theoretically, anyone who has been trained to inject Botox can do so. However, I would recommend a board certified Plastic Surgeon or dermatologist to perform your injections. There are some nurse injectors that are really competent as well.</p><p>Some states prohibit medical practitioners other than physicians to perform injections. (Thomas Guillot, MD, Baton Rouge Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Medical procedures should be performed by trained medical personnel</h4><p>Botox is a medical procedure and should be performed by someone with a deep understanding of facial anatomy and clinical pharmacology. These are things that can’t be learned at a weekend course or by just watching another doctor do the procedure.<br>

</div>Oculoplastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons and dermatologists receive extensive training in these prerequisites and are most qualified to inject Botox. (Matheson A. Harris, MD, Salt Lake City Oculoplastic Surgeon)
<h3>Botox and Dysport should be performed by board-certified aesthetic physician</h3><p>Definitely seek out board-certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon if you can. You would not want to see a dermatologist if you need to have childbirth delivery. </p><p>Avoid comparison shopping based on price alone as Botox/Dysport and fillers injections do require expertise and artistry that are afforded by experienced board-certified physicians. (William Ting, MD, Bay Area Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Qualified or Quantified?</i></p><p>The product is sold to any doctor, even dentists are using it. So it goes deeper than who is using it and how much are they doing.<br>

</div>You could be doing something wrong for years and not know it. So look for experts in skin and facial anatomy. Dermatologists, plastic surgeons. facial plastic surgeons, oculoplastic surgeons. These are the skin and facial anatomy experts who can maximize your results while minimizing any chance of complications.
<p>Dont let nonphysicians inject you, this product is expensive and can cause problems if done poorly or incorrectly….insist on having the doctor do it . If they tell you the doctor doesnt do the injections themselves then ask yourself why are you getting your injections done in a place where the “supervising” doctor doesnt know how to do it themselves.</p><p>The doctor is the one who the company sent the product to not the staff members. If you think non-physicians are qualified to inject… just so you know a front desk receptionist is just as qualified to inject as the nurse… </p><p>Botox or facial injections for that matter are not part of any nursing school training. In fact, in some places that is who will be injecting you, the former front desk receptionist who was promoted to “injection specialist.”<br>

</div>So beware and always fall back on the doctors credentials…ultimately they are the ones responsible and nothing else matters. (Shawn Allen, MD, Boulder Dermatologist)
<p><em>Find top Botox injectors through Allergan</em></p><p>The Botox Cosmetic website is a great source of information. It can also help you find a “Black Diamond Level” provider in your area. The “Black diamond level” practices generally use a lot of Botox, and that means a lot of experience.</p><p>That also means more rebates and specials only available through the top providers of Botox. </p><p>You should still ask questions about how long the injector has been using Botox Cosmetic and how many patients they see each week for Botox.</p><p>View before and after photos and proceed with a treatment, only after you feel like all of your questions have been answered in a consultation. (Michael Law, MD, Raleigh-Durham Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox injector requirements</h3><p>Although ANYBODY with a medical license or “supervised” (even “off site”) by anyone with a medical license CAN inject Botox, I would NOT have them treat me, my family or friends. For the best possible results, insist on having a Plastic Surgeon, ENT or Dermatologist personally inject YOUR Botox.</p><p>There is NO substitute for experience. Although I could delegate it, in my practice I administer Botox and very much enjoy doing it. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox and Safety</b></p><p>From time to time, there has been mention of Botox having caused death. The majority of these cases were being treated for Cerebral Palsy and other neurological disorders. The doses being injected were given during a scientific study and were massive by cosmetic standards.</p><p>Just to give you an example, the doses used in the scientific study were in the range of up to 700 units. For cosmetic purposes we use a maximum of 75 units. Usually we only use 20 to 40 units.</p><p>It is very important that you trust that the person who is administering Botox is using the official Botox from Allergan and not a non-FDA look-a-like product. I only approve of using the bonafide Botox manufactured by Allergan.</p><p>I can’t stress to you how important it is that before you opt to get any type of non-surgical facial rejuvenation treatment that you thoroughly understand the training and experience of your plastic surgeon or dermatologist.</p><p>My first concern is, as always, for the safety of the patient.
