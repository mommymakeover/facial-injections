<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><em>Botox cost depends on units</em></p><p>Botox is usually priced per unit or area. A fair and comparative way would be finding out the number of units required.</p><p>Usually between the eyebrows takes about 20-25 units, forehead takes about 10-20 units and crows feet takes about 20 to 40 units.</p><p>The average price per unit ranges from 8 to 15. I would question who is doing the actualy injection and their experience when choosing the office and not just go based on the lower price. (Peyman Ghasri, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologist)</p><p><i>Botox cost varies according to how much you need and geographic area</i></p><p>Botox costs vary between regions and doctors. In New York City, where I practice, it is usually about $22 per unit, although it can be lower or higher. In order to compare prices, you need to know how many units the doctor is going to use to treat you.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1698" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>So, at $22 per unit, if you need 25 units to treat forehead creases, the cost would be $550. If you need 20 units, it would be $500. Some doctors charge by the number of areas treated. This makes Botox cost comparisons difficult because you do not know how many units you are receiving.</p><p>However, I do not recommend using price alone to determine from whom you will receive your treatment. A physician who charges less may not do the procedure herself; likewise, the doctor may not be an expert in Botox administration like plastic surgeons and dermatologists are.</p><p>If the price is very low for your geographic area, beware. Look for doctors who will customize your treatment and use only as much Botox as is necessary to achieve a good result. When considering cost, keep in mind that if you receive regular Botox treatments, you eventually will need 3-4 treatments per year to keep up your refreshed appearance.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1699" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Some patients require less Botox as time goes on and thereby the costs are slightly less from year to year. (Tracy Pfeifer, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>We charge $325 for one area of Botox (20 units) and $600 for two areas (40 units) and for additional units about $10 per additional unit. You can always find someplace cheaper, but beware of places that seem too cheap.</p><p>There are spas that open up and have people injecting Botox after taking a weekend course. It costs more to have an experienced physician treat you, but it is worth it. (Todd Minars, MD, Miami Dermatologist)</p><p>The cost of Botox can vary based on your location. Also, it is very important to ensure you are getting Botox from an experienced injection specialist.</p><p>Often, people seek a cheaper rate and get injections from places that do not have the experience or education to handle potential negative effects.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1700" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Based on location an experienced injection specialist would charge anywhere from $10-$20 per unit. Some offices may also charge based on the area you are having injected.</p><p>Your biggest consideration again should be to ensure the experience of your professional. (Anup Patel, MD, MBA, Orlando Physician)</p><h4>Average cost of Botox</h4><p>In the US, the average overhead on a unit of Botox (price of the vial and the cost to inject it) is $ 8-10. The average price for injection varies from 10-15 per unit depending on the area.</p><p>Some practices go by syringes but it is easier and more transparent to go by units i think. One advice is not to try to push your doctor to inject 20 units to cover your whole face.</p><p>I tell by patients to stick to one area in order to inject the proper concentration. (Hisham Seify, MD, PhD, FACS, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1701" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h5>Botox costs depend on units required</h5><p>Botox is the most common cosmetic treatment today with millions of doses administered by practitioners of all types, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and spa and salon operators in the Chicago area.</p><p>The cost of Botox varies by the units of medication provided, though some charge by the area of the face treated.</p><p>Our practice charges $16 per unit of Botox, and the average treatment is 20 units or $320. The treatment interval with Botox averages four to six months, though Botox recommends treatments at three to four months intervals to maintain a even effect.</p><p></p>

</div>In our office I perform all the injections, and carefully map the areas by location and units applied.
<p>It is possible to be less than perfect with the first treatment, though with repetition and good records the treatment can be refined to an individuals unique requirements. I feel that it is this consistency and relationship that keeps our patients coming back. Price is only one consideration.</p><p>A lower price might be found, and there are always advertised specials, however it is the experience, consistentcy, and the relationship that puts value into the service.</p><p>Allergan has a discount program you can investigate and is available at offices with experience with the product. These offices are listed on the Allergan website. </p><p>As “everyone” seems to offer Botox today price has become a secondary issue.</p><p>All know the going rates so to speak. I suggest you find a practice you can trust to provide service as well as value. When you find a good match you will want to stick with them for repeat treatments. (Peter E. Johnson, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1703" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h5>Botox price should be determined by the unit</h5><p>It is best to pay for your Botox by the ‘unit’. Each vial of Botox contains 100 units. Every physician may dilute their Botox differently, thus, the best way to compare ‘apples to apples’ is by knowing the price of one ‘unit’ of Botox.</p><p>Most patients who are good candidates for Botox can benefit from 10-20 units in each ‘area’ (glabella, forehead, crow’s feet). However, there are many other areas of the face that may benefit from smaller amounts of Botox such as “smoker’s lines”, corner’s of the mouth, neck bands, dynamic (mobile) nose tip etc. (Sanjay Grover, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The price for Botox charged depends on the expertise, qualifications and experience of the person injecting. In Australia any registered nurse, General Practitioner, Physician and Surgeon can inject Botox. With a Facial Plastic Surgeon you are reassured of their experience and expertise and predictable outcomes.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1704" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-69d878c2edf505f6450abc6b78aa38f5">

</div><p>In my practice I inject all the Botox myself and do not relegate the task to a nurse or a GP. The Botox is measured per unit and the patient is assessed by myself to determine what is needed.</p><p>The units injected can range from 2 to 100 units. The cost of Botox decreases as the units injected increases. We do not charge per area of the face as each face is different. The cost of Botox varies from $15-$18 per unit (inclusive of GST).</p><p>We use Botox by Allergan. Results can last anywhere from at least 4 months to 6 months depending on the facial muscles and wether you have had Botox before. (Pedram Imani, MBBS(Hons), MS(Hons), FRACS, Perth Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The costs of Botox vary widely dependent upon who is actually doing the procedure. Make sure you see a very experienced practice and ask how many units will be required per treatment area as this will determine your final cost.</p><p>Botox costs can vary from $10-16 per unit based upon the experience of the injector and that person’s expertise and training. </p><p>Board certified plastic surgeons and dermatologists may charge on the higher end of this scale as they are experts in the anatomy and treatment options with Botox. (Richard Chaffoo, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Beware of very cheap or discounted Botox</i></p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1705" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Prices in our state typically start at $10 per unit. When Botox is discounted below this level, make sure you are getting the dose you are paying for as Botox can be diluted. The areas you mentioned will require between ten and twenty units per area.</p><p>Find a scrupulous, ethical provider with a good reputation you can trust. Personally, I respect physicians who perform the injections themselves rather than delegating to a lower level provider.</p><p>While the laws in different states vary, I’m always fascinated to discover individuals who are not licensed to practice medicine performing this procedure as if it is just another beauty treatment in a salon like getting a bikini wax. (Trenton C. Jones, MD, Orem Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of Botox is very hard to define because you arent comparing apples to apples. In our area the cost usually ranges from $10-15 per unit. However, the botox can easily be diluted by a less ethical provider and sold for $6-9 per unit.</p><p>You also have to take into account the person doing the injection. If you were going to have someone paint your portrait for an important event you wouldnt pick a house painter to do it.</p><p>You would pick someone with an artistic eye and someone that has done work in the past that you could see. In our office, Nancy, our nurse practitioner has an amazing talent for Botox injections and has numerous years of experience. (Mark E. Freeman, MD, Idaho Falls Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
