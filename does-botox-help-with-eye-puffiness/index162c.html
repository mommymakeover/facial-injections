<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Botox will not likely improve your under-eye puffiness, and sometimes can make it worse by weakening the muscled that helps hold fat pads in place. </p><p>You may benefit from filler to the tear trough region, if you have a hollow, as hollows can give the appearance of fullness above the shadows.</p><p>If you do not have a hollow, blepharoplasty may be your best option to improve puffiness but keep in mind that sleep, salt, allergies and other things impact potential eye bags in some people. (Catherine Winslow, MD, Indianapolis Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox and under eye puffiness</h5><p>Botox is a great treatment for the crows feet, forehead lines and the lines between the eyes.  Botox relaxes muscles which then prevents the movement that causes the lines of facial expression.  Botox is not used to treat under-eye puffiness.<br>

</div>Sometimes, filler can be used to treat the under-eye area which can smooth out the transition from the eyelid to the cheek. For the most accurate advice, I would recommend and in person consultation. (Quenby Erickson, DO, FAAD, FACMS, Chicago Dermatologic Surgeon)
<p><b>Botox to treat wrinkles, but not puffiness</b></p><p>Botox is a neuromodulator medication injected into muscles to weaken their ability to pull on skin, creating fewer wrinkles that form when we move our faces. These are called dynamic wrinkles. Static wrinkles or wrinkles that hang around while are faces are relaxed, puffiness, contour, or pigmentation issues are not addressed with Botox, but with other treatments.</p><p> I recommend having a consultation with a physician who can take a medical history, examine your face, and even take photographs for analysis. </p><p>She/he can then present a treatment plan with options appropriate for your face. Safety comes first. (Victor Chung, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h5>Botox for puffiness under the eyes</h5><p>Unfortunately, Botox will not help puffiness under the eyes, which is a complex issue. Botox is better for dynamic wrinkles… wrinkles that come with expressions. Visit with a dermatologist or plastic surgeon to assess your options.</p><p>Sometimes it can be fixed with fillers, other times surgery may be needed. (Jacquelyn Dosal, MD, Miami Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>  In the majority of cases for undereye puffiness Botox will not improve the overall appearance.  A dermal filler may be a better treatment, depending on what the puffiness is a result of. (Nelson Castillo, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is a great treatment that is used to relax the muscles and improve the appearance of wrinkles. It can be used around the eyes in the area that is commonly referred to as “crow’s feet”.<br>

</div>Unfortunately Botox will not help with puffiness under the eyes. There are several treatments that we offer here at Refined Dermatology to improve under eye concerns. These treatments include radio frequency systems such as Pelleve, Ultherapy or dermal fillers. (Steven Swengel, MD, Los Gatos Dermatologic Surgeon)
<p><em>Botox for under-eye puffiness</em></p><p>It depends.  Botox (or Dysport) is most often used to reduce the frown lines between the brows, the crow’s feet, and wrinkles across the forehead.  But there are some lesser known ways that Botox can be used.</p><p> Without seeing you, it’s impossible to give you a definitive answer, but if you have a muscle roll under your eyes that is causing a look of puffiness (orbicularis roll), Botox can reduce this under eye fullness.</p><p> If the puffiness is due to bulging under-eye fat (more common than orbicularis roll), then Botox won’t help- in that case you’ll either need lower blepharoplasty surgery or under-eye fillers. (Brett S. Kotlus, MD, MS, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h5>BOTOX under eyes</h5><p> BOTOX helps soften the laugh lines under the eyes when smiling and also a bit while at rest. It really does not treat the puffiness under the eyes. (Pedy Ganchi, MD, Ridgewood Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox indications around eyes </b></p><p>Botox is a wonderful drug and can drastically improve to lines around someones eyes, however it will not do anything for the bags under the eyes. Botox works by decreasing the contraction of the muscles in the area around the eye.</p><p>Lines that most people call “crows feet” and that deepen when we squint are best treated with Botox. </p><p>It is difficult to recommend a treatment for your puffiness under eyes without a photo, but some treatments include removal of the fat pad, or using fillers to mask shadowing, but it may be as simple as using a good eye cream that has a growth factor to help thicken the tissue that can lose some of its elasticity. (Phillip Chang, MD, Leesburg Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<i>Undereye puffiness treatments</i><p>Botox is a great treatment for upper face lines and wrinkles. Around the eyes, it is commonly used to treat lateral canthal lines or “crow’s feet”. That being said, Botox is not a treatment for puffiness under the eyes.</p><p>There are several ways to treat the puffiness. If the “puffiness” is the result of fat herniation, then the fat can be removed during blepharoplasty, a surgical procedure. The fat can also be camouflaged using fillers such as Belotero or Restylane.</p><p>Finally, if the puffiness is related to swelling from fluid buildup, then topical skin care products such as those containing caffeine can also help reduce the puffiness. Finally, avoiding smoking, reducing salt intake, and using sun protection is always good for the skin around the eyes. (Shaun Patel, MD, Miami Physician)<br>

<em>Botox does not address puffiness around the eyes</em><p>Botox is a purified protein used to address wrinkles associated with facial expression such as the crows feet seen around the eyes when one smiles. Botox does not address puffiness around the eyes. Puffiness can be treated with eye creams and various laser treatments. (Alex Eshaghian, MD, PhD, Encino Physician)</p><p><strong>I would like to get Botox for the 1st time. Will it help the puffiness underneath my eyes?</strong></p><p>In general, Botox is used to treat “dynamic” lines that form as a result of muscle movement. Botox can be used to treat the wrinkles around the eyes known as “crow’s feet,” but it will not specifically address puffiness.</p><p>There are treatments available for improving the appearance of puffiness under the eyes; an in-person consult would be necessary in order to obtain a solution that is customized to your individual needs. I would recommend a consultation with a board certified and experienced facial plastic surgeon.</p><p>He/she will be able to provide you with advice following an exam. (Paul S. Nassif, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox cannot improve puffiness under the eyes. You should consult a board certified plastic surgeon, oculoplastic or facial plastic surgeon to discuss your options. (Melvin Elson, MD, Nashville Dermatologist)</p><p><b>Botox can’t help under eye puffiness</b></p><p>Botox injections will not improve the puffiness you have under your eyes. It works to reduce wrinkles that occur with muscle movement, such as forehead lines, crow’s feet and glabellar lines (between your eyebrows). (Ramon Peleaux, DDS, MD, Charlotte Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox won’t help puffiness under eyes</em></p><p>Botox is used to improve the active wrinkles that occur with movement. Around the eyes, it helps with the crows feet. Without a picture, I can’t make recommendations but often filler is able to be placed around the eye to make the puffiness seem better.</p><p>In some cases, placing Botox around the eye can make puffiness worse. Make sure you see a board certified physician in this field. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is a Neurotoxin that is used to treat and help diminish the wrinkles in the face. It can help with crows feet around the eyes, but is not going to help with any “puffiness” that you may have under.</p><p>It works strictly on the muscles of the face. (Lawrence Bundrick, MD, Huntsville Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox around the eyes</h4><p>Botox is used to reduce the motion of specific muscles around the eyes. This will reduce the wrinkling one see around the eyes while smiling (crows feet). Based on your question, it sounds like you are referring to the fullness underneath the eye that is typically associated with adipose tissue becoming more prominent as we age Botox will not address this specific issue.</p><p>Fillers like Restylane can be used to camouflage this issue, but if it is severe, surgery may be the only solution. (Satyen Undavia, MD, Philadelphia Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
