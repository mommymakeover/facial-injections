<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The Botox party idea that a large number of patients can be seen in a couple of hours is not considered safe practice with only one injector present.</p><p>Your injector’s most important presentation to you should be efficacy and safety, not speed and a low price.</p><p>Remember, before and after photos are always important not only for the physician’s records but for you as the patient to be able to see that you have received desired results. (Joseph Serota, MD, Aurora Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox party concerns</h4><p>It’s important to make sure that the injector you have chosen is experienced, skilled, and qualified.</p><p>This means that if an RN is doing the injections, the doctor’s approval has been made aware to you and you are able to contact that doctor should you desire.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3492" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Also, it’s important to make sure that the medical professional involved in this procedure (including the person doing the injections and the overseeing physician if you choose an injector that is not an MD) are easily accessible to you following the Botox party should you have concerns.</p><p>Do they have an office close to you? Do they have certifications that show you they are qualified? Even at a Botox party, normal injectable protocols should be followed. This includes patient medical history, physical facial assessment, standard precautions, consult with patient education, informed consent, photos, post instructions, and a number to reach the medical professional for future care and follow up.</p><p>Botox parties are not safe (especially if there is not physician). But it depends on what you mean by a “Botox party”.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3493" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If a physician is having a promotional event at their office, but you are still being injected in an exam room under ideal conditions, that is probably okay.</p><p>The problem when you leave a physician’s office, is that many of the controlled variables (lighting, sterility etc…) become uncontrolled.</p><p>Also, be careful at these parties that they are actually injecting Botox. I have seen cases in Miami where patients had “unknown” things injected in them at people’s homes and they had disfiguring outcomes. (Todd Minars, MD, Miami Dermatologist)</p><h5>It is not a party if someone gets hurt</h5><p>Botox parties can be safe if conducted by a board certified plastic surgeon. Too frequently these parties are run by non experts who risk sterility, improper handling of botox, and improper techniques which can lead to a variety of issues up to and including blindness. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3494" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><strong>Botox parties..the real deal</strong></p><p>Botox parties can be safe if staffed by a qualified physician. A couple reasons why botox parties may be a problem:</p><ol>
<li>Alcohol may be served and it may cloud the judgement of the patient to get Botox and the amount and location. You can’t really consent to anything with alcohol on board.</li>
<li>There are other people there so a patient can get pressured to get botox even if she feels she doesn’t really want any.</li>
</ol><p>The consent process of any procedure is done with the doctor and patient alone. Something to keep in mind. (Chris Thiagarajah, MD, Denver Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>‘Botox parties’ are putting yourself at risk. This is a procedure that you are doing to make yourself look better, so why take ANY risk of it going wrong. Botox in a clinical setting is a safe procedure.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3495" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In a party setting all bets are off. Most of the time it is done in a salon or home which by no means is a sterile condition. First and foremost….safety fist!!!. (Lisa Kates, MD, Annapolis Dermatologist)</p><p><b>Botox party pooper</b></p><p>Botox should ideally be performed in a clinical setting. This allows for a proper evaluation, discussion, treatment and follow-up. If someone is hosting a Botox party, questions that should be asked would be</p><ol>
<li>what is their board certification</li>
<li>are proper before and after pictures to be taken</li>
<li>is appropriate informed consent being given. (Thomas W. Bender, III MD, Mobile Dermatologic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><p><b>The risk is small but not zero at Botox parties</b></p><p>If your Botox party is hosted by a qualified physician who is using the real product (not lab Botox or other substance) you should be fine. I don’t do Botox parties because I meet the patients, examine them, take photos and consent them.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3496" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>This way we have a proper medical record for future treatments and if a problem were to occur we can figure out why. My only real worry is the horror stories of people going to a hotel room to one of these parties and having who knows what injected by some shady character and patients have a bad reaction to the substance without any way to track down what happened. (Ivan Wayne, MD, Oklahoma City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Medical office is the best place to receive Botox</b></p><p>Botox injections should be performed in a professional setting of a medical office. The procedure should be performed by a board certified physician only. The procedure is safe when performed properly and in the proper setting. (Steven Hacker, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3497" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><em>Botox parties – not worth the risk</em></p><p>I have to agree with my colleagues – botox parties are not safe. This is still a procedure best performed by a physician in a physician’s office. There are risks and complications that can occur.</p><p>You still need to get an accurate history and physical from a patient. What if they forget to tell you they are on anticoagulants for example. You need to have the appropriate informed consent as well.</p><p>This is a medical procedure and should be handled as such. Avoid the Botox parties like the H1N1 virus. (Steven Schuster, MD, FACS, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Say “No” to Botox Parties</i></p><p>Botox is truly one of the nicest tools in our aesthetic toolbox for helping to reduce wrinkles and the signs of aging. Like any aesthetic procedure, it should be performed by someone who is fully licensed, trained, and experienced in aesthetic medicine, such as a Dermatologist, Plastic Surgeon or Ophthalmologist.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3498" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>A thorough evaluation in a non-pressured environment to assess your wishes and desires and review the risks and benefits of treatment is essential. Unfortunately, too often we see these “Botox Parties” put on around town by poorly trained or insufficiently credentialed injectors.</p><p>Add in the heavy “salesman” pressure, peer pressure and alcohol, and you have an environment ripe for unhappy patients and poor results. Treat Botox as you would any important medical or surgical decision. Choose an experienced, respected physician you trust who treats your concerns with the professionalism they deserve. (Jeffrey C. Poole, MD, Metairie Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>The skinny on Botox Parties</strong></p><p>There are parties and there are PARTIES!!! Botox should be injected by appropriately trained medical personnel at the appropriate setting. Having said that, having a party and an education session on botox and other treatments are acceptable, in my opinion.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3499" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>On the other hand,injecting people in a party, specially after there has been consumption of alcohol,brings the issue of informed consent into question. Bottom line, botox injection is a medical procedure that should be done by the appropriate person in the appropriate setting. (J. Vicente P. Poblete, MD, Cleveland Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Have Botox in a medical setting so you can go to the party</h4><p>Botox parties are dangerous for many reasons:</p><ol>
<li class="amp-wp-inline-bf8783a8de6c7b7c19475883bdb831d2">
<ol>
<li>Reputable doctors don’t have them. So if you’re at one outside of a medical setting, beware of who’s treating you.</li>
<li>You have no idea what type of product you’re really getting if you’re not with a reputable physician (see #1 again) in their office. This is a recipe for disaster.</li>
<li>Potential side effects, even with the genuine product, are real. Do you want droopy eyelids and brows for 2-3 months?</li>
<li>A party-type atmosphere (with or without alcohol, but certainly with alcohol) is no place for a medical treatment.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3500" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Privacy in this instance, free of peer pressure or other distractions, will lead to the best outcomes. Doesn’t sound like a great party. Skip the Botox “party”, confidently get the real thing by a reputable physician, and enjoy needle free social events for months to come. (Chad L. Prather, MD, Baton Rouge Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>If the Botox “party” is in the doctors office it would be OK. You should have it done in a medical facility where all necessary equipment is available. The atmosphere is generally festive when people are having positive procedures being done to them. (Carlos Wolf, MD, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Peril of Botox Parties</em></p><p>The atmosphere at parties hardly lends itself to medical treatments. What if someone has an unusual reaction? What about informed medical consent? What if you injector is having too much “fun” and injects into the wrong location? Botox is indeed a medical treatment and as such requires both a medical atmosphere and a properly trained, experienced injector.</p><p>Although the idea may sound appealing, you would be taking unnecessary risks. Physicians are trained to handle the “what if” in a medical setting, not at a party where the mix of social drinking is usually occurring.</p><p>The casual flip of the hand or attention drawn away at the sound of laughter or loud talk could misdirect a needle–around the eyes that is certainly a danger you don’t need to expose yourself to.</p><p>Keep your medical treatments in a medical office and keep your selection of medical providers to those who are skilled and professional.
