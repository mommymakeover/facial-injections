<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Botox comes as a powder and has to be mixed with saline and the recommended amount is 2.5 cc giving 4 units for every 0.1 cc so in the volume amount you pay for the units of Botox.</p><p>Be sure you see a board ceritifed dermatologist. (Melvin Elson, MD, Nashville Dermatologist)</p><p>Botox comes as a powder, with 100 units in a bottle. It has to be be reconstituted. If you were to use 4 cc of solution to mix with the botox powder, then, you would have 25 Units per cc.</p><p>If you were to use 2 cc of solution, you would have 50 Units per cc, and so on. The concentration of solution does matter – more concentrated solutions tend to spread out less. So, the treating physician can use this to help the patient’s specific needs.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4331" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If you were treating a large area like the forehead, you might wish to use a 25 U / cc mix. If you were treating an area where spread of the effect would be undesirable, you could consider using less of a stronger mix. (Thomas Fiala, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Mixing Botox</b></p><p>Botox is always mixed with a saltwater solution it is part of the way that it is given Botox is delivered to the doctor’s office in a crystallized form it requires Saline to dissolve the crystals and then you can inject it into the desired area. (Paul C. Dillon, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox must be reconstituted with saline in order to be injected as it comes in a solid powder state in the vial. How much saline is added varies from provider to provider based on their preference and should not affect cost, since it will be based on the number of units used.

</div><p>A unit of botox is a unit of botox. Diluting botox just means you need more volume to reach the same level of potency. If you feel you are not receiving the right amount of botox, speak with your injector or find a new one. (Benjamin C. Paul, MD, New York Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>All Botox and Dysport come in a powder and the provider must mix it into a solution.</p><p>The way in which the Botox is administered relies on the skill, knowledge, and experience of the doctor performing the treatment.</p><p>If you shop around purely for lowest cost, it may be more expensive in the long run if you are dissatisfied with the treatment and/or you require a correction from a different provider. (Brett S. Kotlus, MD, MS, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4333" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><i>Botox diluation before injections</i></p><p>Botox is shipped by the manufacturer to the clinics in a powder form. This is needed for maintaining the stability and strength of the product. Botox does need to be reconstituted with saline before the injections, as powder cannot be injected.</p><p>The amount of dilution with saline may vary from one clinic to another, depending on the preference of the injector. However, the amount of units injected remains the same. (Alain Michon, MD, Ottawa Physician)</p><h3>Botox “dilution”</h3><p>Botox is manufactured in a powder form. Your doctor must dissolve that powder with saline before it is injected. This does not make Botox diluted, it just puts it in a form that is usable.</p><p>Your doctor determines how much of the solution needs to be injected in order to get the amount of units of Botox desired. When you pay per unit for Botox you a paying for the exact amount of pure Botox that you are receiving. (Marc Cohen, MD, Philadelphia Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4334" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Botox comes in a powder form and must be mixed with saline in order to be injected. However, you will pay for the amount of Botox used. Keep in mind, it will take 1-2 weeks to see final results with Botox. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>We charge per unit and we do charge only for units of botox injected. Ensure that you are choosing an ethical and expert physician injector who is using genuine botox. Less reputable centers and injectors may not be using genuine botox from Allergan compromising both the safety and efficacy of the results. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is typically priced per unit or per area treated. When you purchase by the unit you are paying for the amount of the medication being injected during your treatment. The vehicle for delivering the Botox injection is the fluid used to reconstitute the Botox.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4335" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Some providers prefer larger volume than others but the amount of Botox Being applied may be the same as measured in units. . (Sean R. Weiss, MD, FACS, New Orleans Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>When you see a qualified injector, you are getting a number of units of Botox or Dysport. We understand how certain muscles in the face respond to a certain number of units of either Botox or Dysport.</p><p>Botox and Dysport do come in a dried powder form and have to be reconstituted with saline in order for it to be injectable.</p><p>The type of dilution is injector dependent (some may add more or less) but you should still be receiving the number of units you are paying for.

</div><p>I charge by the area and not by the units. I imagine those that charge by the units, charge by the units of botox injected and not by the solution that it is diluted in. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Price of Botox Pure</h3><p>Botox comes in a powder form usually containing 100 units and has to be mixed with Saline. Different physicians use different dilutions of Saline to mix the Botox. In general, Botox is usually diluted between 2-3 cc’s of Saline per 100 unit bottle.</p><p>No matter what dilution is used, each cc will contain a certain amount of units of Botox. You should only pay for the amount of Botox units used. For example, in our clinic, we use 2.5 cc’s of Saline to dilute the Botox, so that 0.01 cc has 4 units of Botox. The average person needs 20 units on their forehead. With my dilution, I would need to inject 0.5 cc’s in order to give you 20 units.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4337" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In another office where it was diluted differently, it may take 0.7cc’s to attain 20 units. (Simone A. McKitty, MD, Torrance Physician)</p><p>Botox bottle has 100 Units of powder form or 50 Units I try to buy 50 units, and I use all of it for one patient Recommendation is 1 cc saline for 40 units of botox 11 line need minimum 20 units Forehead need minimum 10 units crows feet each side need 10 units Total 50 units in average Some people with larger muscles might need more Botox But Botox is foe prevention of muscle contraction so the wrinkle does not form but someone who has a lot of collagen and fat lost Botox might not be enough (Ramtin Massoudi, MD, Beverly Hills Physician)</p><p>Botox is usually charged in one of two ways; by the unit, or by the area. In either circumstance you are paying for the product after it is reconstituted in solution. Some offices will reconstitute it differently but there is always a unit value.

</div><p><b>Botox units and dilution.</b></p><p>In general, when you are paying for Botox units you are paying for the pure Botox. Botox is stored in a powdered form until it is mixed with saline in preparation for injection. The concentration of the prepared Botox depends on the treatment area and/or injector preference, however, you will still get the full amount of the Botox units agreed upon.</p><p>For example, if a more dilute mixture of Botox is used, a greater volume may have to be injected, and vice versa. (Sean W. Delaney, MD, Houston Physician)</p><p>Botox comes as a dehydrated powder in vials of either 50 or 100 units. This powder is reconstituted with salt water when ready for injection and can have different concentrations based on the amount of salt water used.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4339" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>That said the same 50/100 units is in the vial so you see regardless of “pure” or “buffered” Botox units are units and do not chance. . (Nelson Castillo, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox dilution and units</h3><p>When Botox arrives from Allergan it is in a frozen crystalline form that needs to be reconstituted with normal saline. When being charged by the unit, the cost per unit is important rather than the volume of Botox that is being injected.</p><p>Each practice reconstitutes the Botox at a dilution rate that they prefer so the amount of volume my be different from one practice to another even though the number of units injected may be the same. (Richard E. Moore, MD, Saint Louis Physician)</p><p><em>Botox comes as a powder</em></p><p>Botox is shipped to the physicians and hospitals as a powder with controlled, cool packaging. The powder needs to be reconstituted with saline as one cannot inject a powder. Different providers use different amounts of saline reconstitution.</p><p>The unit dose will be the same, but the concentration can differ due to the amount of saline added. Beer, wine, and whiskey have different concentrations but all can affect your ability to drive depending on the amount taken, not the concentration.</p><p>My concentration is 2.5 cc of saline per hundred units and has been the same for more than a decade. (Keith Denkler, MD, Marin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It’s botox mixed with normal saline,that u pay for and not the purified form and that’s how the units are calculated. (Ayesha Akbar, MD, Frankfort Physician)</p><p><em>Botox units</em></p><p>There is no way to deliver botox until it is reconstituted in injectable saline. Practitioners have their reasons for how much fluid they like to use, so the same number of units may come in a different volume within the syringe, when you compare different injectors.</p><p>Consider a practice that charges by site rather than unit to make certain that your aesthetic goals will be met. (George Bitar, MD, Fairfax Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox reconstitution</h4><p>Botox is shipped to physicians by Allergan as freeze dried crystals that need to be reconstituted with saline prior to injection. Botox Cosmetic comes in 50 unit and 100 unit vials. Most physicians that I know of charge by units of Botox used although some do price based on region of the face treated.
