<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>BOTOX tends to last 3 to 4 months for most people, but everyone is different and each treatment is different. There are many variables. One of the more important variables is the amount of BOTOX that is used in each treatment.</p><p>This is not the amount of injections! It is the number of units. Using more units will lead to more weakening of the muscles and will last longer … but it comes with a price! The more BOTOX that is used, the higher the chances of obtaining a “droopy brow,” which many confuse with a “droopy eyelid.”</p><p> More BOTOX can lead to a more severe droop and one that may last longer. So I think that it is best to use less more often rather than use more less often. It will provide a more natural look with less chance of undesirable results. (Louis C. Cutolo, Jr., MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>The longevity of your BOTOX results depends on a few different factors, including where on your face the product is administered. As a general rule, areas that see more movement tend to have more short-lived results.
<p>The severity of your lines can also influence how%. (Susan M. Stuart, MD, San Diego Dermatologist)</p><p>Botox typically lasts 3 months. Some people it may last a little longer and some people a little less. Overtime as the muscles are weakened, the interval can often be extended somewhat, and the dosage decreased Learn more:. (Brian Arslanian, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Results vary</i></p><p>The results from a Botox injection can last from three to six months. Revance therapuetics has a new botulinum toxin in development that seems to last a month longer than Allergan’s Botox. (Keith Denkler, MD, Marin Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h3>Depends On Several Factors</h3><p>Botox typically lasts 4-5 months, depending on several individual factors such as the muscle size, location and amount of activity. Most patients will get a “touch up” or follow up injection approximately every 4 months or so before the effect is completely gone in order to be more consistent and to keep the fine lines from reforming.</p><p>If your treated muscles are more active than average, you may need another injection sooner. It is important to understand that Botox, and other neuromodulators and injectables must be individualized to each patient’s anatomy in order to obtain the most natural and balanced results.</p><p>At our practice we have found that medical skin care and improving skin health before as well as after Botox or other injectables and aesthetic procedures can significantly enhance and prolong an optimal outcome. (Frank Barone, MD, Toledo Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>On average, Botox last about 3-4 months. The amount of units used and the placement of the Botox will determine how well it will work for you. (Robert Heck, MD, FACS, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)
<p>I tell my patients that Botox will last 3 to 4 months. However I have seen Botox last anywhere from 2 to 6 months depending on the thickness of the muscles that are being injected. This also depends on the amount of Botox that is being injected into the area.</p><p>I try to adjust the volume of Botox based on the patient’s muscle thickness to achieve a longer lasting result. (Robert Najera, MD, Frisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Generally, patients see visible results from Botox for 3 to 4 months post treatment. However, there is individual variability because every patient is unique. Some patients see the results drop off closer to the 3 month mark while others continue to see results for up to 5 months. (Scott Chapin, MD, FACS, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Botox on average lasts 3-4 months. I do have many patients who visit every 6 months for their treatment. I do feel that with repeated injections, some patients can wait a bit longer between treatment intervals. (T.G. Khan, DO, FACS, Fort Lee Oculoplastic Surgeon)
<h4>How Long Does Botox Last? Average, 4 months. Not Everyone is Average! </h4><p>The majority of patients have a good Botox result that lasts about 4 months. But some people chew it up in 3 months, others keep a great result for 6 months. Often, under dosing can lead to unhappiness.</p><p>Sometimes, patients are on a budget and try to squeak by on a tiny dose of Botox. Sometimes, this works beautifully, sometimes, early breakthrough results. It is important to discuss this with your plastic surgeon and agree on a strategy going forward. (Luke J. Curtsinger, MD, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Typically the results of Botox will last 3-4 months. Some people can stretch it out to 6 months between appointments as the desired result is subjective. (Jeffrey Weinzweig, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)
<p><em>Botox durability</em></p><p>While I have some patients who only come in once per year on their birthday, no one believes or informs their patients that Botox will last this long. Some believe, however, that with regular injection in the same area 2-3 times per year, muscle atrophy may occur and ultimately provide a longer lasting result in terms of wrinkle diminishment over the person who only uses Botox sporadically. (Trenton C. Jones, MD, Orem Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox typically lasts 3.5 to 4 months</h5><p>On average, Botox results last for 3.5 to 4 months and our typical patients visit us 3 times per year to maintain continuous results. Of course, results may vary and we occasionally see patients who only require treatments 2 times/year (with results lasting 6 months) and on the other spectrum those who “wear off” Botox slightly faster. (Andrei Metelitsa, MD, FRCPC, FAAD, Calgary Dermatologic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Botox generally last about 3 months and needs to be repeated to prevent the reappearance of lines that form when you move your facial muscles. There is some variation in the absorption of the product which affects how long it lasts.
<p>I have patients that tell me it lasts for 6 months, but this is the exception. (Michael Bublik, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox typically lasts about 3-4 months for most people. This is the period in which the muscles remain relaxed. It is best to get re-treated when you start to notice movement returning and not wait until the wrinkles return or wait until full muscle activity returns.</p><p>Botox works best to prevent the wrinkles of facial expression from becoming permanent lines at rest. When you let the Botox wear off completely, and all muscle activity returns to baseline, you are allowing those facial expressions to wrinkle the skin again and eventually the lines may persist even after you get Botox and other treatments may be needed in addition to Botox to improve the lines.<br>

</div>That being said, If you are finding that your Botox wears off sooner than 3 months it can mean that you need more or that your muscles are just particularly strong. Generally, when higher doses are used it lasts longer. (Quenby Erickson, DO, FAAD, FACMS, Chicago Dermatologic Surgeon)
<p>Botox lasts between 3 and 4 months. Most commonly results vary from patient to patient and a great relationship between the surgeon and patient will get you to your desired result and timing for future injections. (Sean Paul, MD, Austin Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox for facial wrinkles lasts on average 3-4 months, with some sensitive patients noting that it still works even at 6 months. For underarm hyperhidrosis Botox lasts 4-6 months. (Kaleroy Papantoniou, MD, FAAD, Great Neck Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>It is estimated that Botox can last anywhere from 3-6 months. For some individuals they feel Botox can last up to a year. This is all dependent on the number of units you receive, how quickly your body metabolizes the product, and strength of the muscles in your “problem” areas.<br>

</div>Initially you may feel the Botox only lasted 3 months, but after layering the product and continually paralyzing or relaxing the muscles you will notice more longevity with your Botox. (Timothy Treece, MD, FACS, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Many factors can affect the efficacy and lifespan of Botox. The most important aspect of seeking Botox treatments is ensuring that the facility has highly trained injectors performing the procedure. Feel free to ask specific questions about the treatment you are receiving, and ensure your questions are answered fully before proceeding.</p><p>With that being said, Botox typically lasts 3-4 months in the average patient. There are instances, however, where Botox last much longer or much less than the average amount of time. If you received good results with your injection (decreased or lack of movement of the targeted muscles), then a good rule of thumb is to return when you begin seeing your baseline movement returning.</p><p>For most patients, this will be between 3-4 months. But if you begin having movement at 2 months, you can certainly return for treatment. By the same token, if it has been 5 months since your treatment and you still have the desired effects of your Botox treatment (lack of or decrease in movement), there is no need to return until movement begins to return.</p><p>Staying on top of your treatment and returning when movement begins to come back is essential to preventing deep lines that make us look aged and worn. Stay young and rejuvenated with current Botox treatments! (Nana N. Mizuguchi, MD, FACS, Louisville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox Cosmetic typically lasts 3-4 months, with some lucky patients experiencing results that last as long as 6 months. Hyperhidrosis treatments typically last 3-6 months, with some patients reporting results that last up to 9 months. (Thomas McFadden, MD, Greenville Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
