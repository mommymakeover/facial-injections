<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h3>Botox cost varies but there are avenues that approach the perfect pricing model</h3><p>I agree with the prior posts – however, Botox prices can now range as low as $8 / unit in some areas to $20 / unit (typically). In general, the price is a premium if a physician injects. Many physicians in larger metropolitan areas may vary the price based upon availability, and some providers (usually non-physicians) dramatically reduce prices with daily deal sites.</p><p>You may want to use resources like ZendyBeauty to find the best prices available in your area with high quality providers. For frown lines, forehead, and crow’s feet – the average patient would require 50-80 units (obviously, depends upon the individual). (Vish Banthia, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1679" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Average cost for Botox</h3><p>The cost for Botox is usually priced by dollar amount per unit. Some areas of the face require more units than others – frown lines and especially masseter or platysma so the total cost is going to depend on the number of units used as well.</p><p>The average cost of Botox in the greater Los Angeles area ranges from $8 per unit to $15 per unit depending on the level of expertise of the injector and any special discounts that may be provided.</p><p>The best price does not mean you’ll get the best results nor does the highest price. Choose an injector based on their credentials, experience, and results/reviews from other patients. (Kristina Tansavatdi, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Atlanta Botox Treatment Cost</h5><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1680" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>We simplified Botox treatment costs for patients at Atlanta Surgical Arts by having flat fees for the most commonly treated areas, which are forehead lines, frown lines, and crow’s feet lines. This really makes it easier for patients to know upfront their treatment cost without having to calculate units and cost per units.</p><ol>
<li>Forehead lines $350</li>
<li>Frown lines $250</li>
<li>Crow’s feet $350</li>
<li>Jaw Angle Reduction $600</li>
</ol><p>Special treatment areas and requests ca be performed accordingly. (C. Carson Huynh, MD, DMD, FACS, Atlanta Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeon)</p><h4>How much does Botox cost in Albany NY</h4><p>When having a Botox injection, it is important to know the number of units used since that ultimately will determine the cost of the procedure. Some physicians charge by the site, for example crow’s feet or the glabellar frown lines, but you then do not know how many units are being used and if that is adequate amount.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1681" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Generally I charge $12 per unit, but Allergen with its Brilliant Distinction Program allows for a rebate to the patient. Since a vial is for single use only and should not be used on multiple patients, I have a minimum injection fee to cover the cost of the material. (William F. DeLuca Jr, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>How Much Does Botox Cost?</em></p><p>Botox is charged very differently in different areas whether it be in a physician’s office to a med spa. A lot of places charge by the unit so that is one thing to keep in mind.</p><p>However, there is no way to see if you receive exactly that amount of units since the Botox powder in the vial has varying amounts of saline added to it.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1682" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You want to come to a good understanding with your physician of what you want to accomplish, duration of result, areas of treatment, and of course your budget.</p><p>Generally if you go to an office that charges by area, they will quote your per area and how many units are injected into that area. Most common areas are forehead, frown area, and crows feet. (Grace Liu, MD, Newport Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of Botox varies practice to practice – some providers price their product by units (we’re in LA and we charge $15/unit, $12/unit when on special- but our injectors are also Allergan Botox Trainers – we also have 2 different reward programs in which our patients can benefit).</p><p>Other providers may charge by area. The most reliable and consistant method is by units. The average female can take 50 units for the 3 areas you mentioned – frown lines, forehead lines and crow’s feet – however this number can vary depending on the strength of your muscles, severity of your lines and desired end result (no movement vs. a more natural result). Your provider would be able to tell you your number of units based upon your consultation and exam. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1683" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><i>Cost of Botox Treatments in San Diego</i></p><p>Firstly, that is one of the most popular combination of areas for Botox treatment in my office. Like others on this panel, I happen to think the fairest method for charging for Botox is by the unit.</p><p>Botox can only be purchased through Allergan here in the United States and comes in a 100 unit bottle typically. The only common denominator between offices is how many units of Botox are you getting – not how many cc’s or syringes or areas are being done.</p><p>Therefore, charging by the unit is completely transparent to the patient. In San Diego, a unit of Botox ranges in price from $7 to $15 per unit, which is quite varied. Most patients in my office get 25 units for the frown lines, 5-10 units for the mid/upper brow and 10-20 units for the crow’s feet.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1684" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Simply calculate the number of units desired by the price per unit in that office and you have the damage! (John M. Hilinski, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Cost of Botox in Manhattan</i></p><p>Botox is unmatched in its effectiveness in addressing forehead lines and crow’s feet wrinkles. The treatment is effective for four months, at which time muscle activity returns to normal and wrinkles return. There have been no reported problems with long term use of Botox.</p><p>In our practice, we charge $500 for the first 10 units of Botox, and $10 per unit after that. When treating the forehead lines and frown lines, we use an average of 30 units, which translates to $700. (Maurice M. Khosh, MD, New York Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Baltimore Botox Pricing</h4><p>Botox costs vary wildly. Botox can either be priced by Unit or by area. I think the easiest way for the patient is to charge for Botox by area. Our cost is $200 per area for up to 17 units.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1685" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>After 17 units, the cost is $12/unit. One Area is bilateral (both sides). This allows you to be able to budget accordingly. If you want crow’s feet and forehead lines, that is 2 areas, or $400. Generally speaking, Botox price is also a function of who is injecting the Botox.</p><p>The cost for an experienced Plastic Surgeon is usually higher than that of an R. N. for obvious reasons. While there are many RN’s who are fabulous injectors, a Plastic Surgeon has a fundamentally larger breadth of experience to handle any type of situation. (Ricardo L. Rodriguez, MD, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox price should be given per unit</em></p><p>The price of botox has significant geographic variability. Prices per unit vary from about $10 per unit to $25 per unit. Each area requires around 10-30 units. Examples of “areas” include; forehead (worry lines), corrugators (frown lines), and orbicularis muscles (smile lines) to name some of the more popular areas of treatment.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1686" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>My fee is $12/ unit and on average use about 20-40 U per patient (depending on what needs to be done). This totals around $250-500. (York Jay Yates, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Three areas of BOTOX costs $725.</h4><p>In my NJ office, you pay per area. Our current Promotion has one area: $350, 2 areas: $550. and 3 areas: $725. Each area gets around 25 units, so treating your frown lines, forehead lines and crow’s feet costs $725 for 75 units.</p><p>I check all of my patients 7 to 14 days post-treatment, and if any additional product is needed, the dose adjustment is free. (Eric M. Joseph, MD, West Orange Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>How much does botox cost?</h4><p>The cost involved when receiving botulinum toxin injections is somewhat variable. There is a cost of the material to the physician (what they pay for the vial) followed by the injection fee. Some practitioners will charge a certain dollar amount per the number of units injected.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1687" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There is a price per unit in this case. Other physicians will charge a set rate for each of the facial anatomic zones injected. These are the forehead, glabella (between the eyes) and the crows feet (around the eyes).</p><p>A physician essetially can set the rate to whatever they feel is appropriate, however, there is essentially a general dollar amount associated with a geographic location (New York City vs a rural community). Like anything, supply and demand and number of physicians who inject in a particular geographic area will all affect the price.</p><p>I would be scrutinous of those who charge a tremendous amount compared to other practitioners and those who seem unusually low priced. (Michael A. Carron, MD, Detroit Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is measured and purchased in units and should be priced in units. Therefore, the question is “what is the price that you are charged per unit and how many units do you need in order to receive an effective and pleasingly aesthetic result?” The number of units you will need will depend on several factors, such as the strength and size of your muscles, as well as gender.</p><p>Men will usually need more units. It will also depend on the area that is being treated. For example, the forehead will generally require fewer units than the frown lines. There are MANY factors to consider.</p><p>Everyone should be assessed individually by the provider as to how many units and where to place the units. We like to call it “your recipe.” When you receive Botox from my office, we record the exact location of each injection and the number of units used.</p><p>This is very important for evaluating results and for future treatments. Having said that, an “average” number of units necessary to treat the glabella frown lines or frown lines between the eyes would be around 20 to 25 units for a female.</p><p>Just remember this is an average. The price per unit in our office is $13.50 per unit. We do offer “Botox Patient Appreciation Days” each month in both of my offices. This is a day where we cater food and gift bags for you and the Botox is $11.50 per unit.</p><p>You will see a wide range of pricing depending on where you live. I must stress that you should never make a decision to receive any injectable product or plastic surgery procedure based on the price.</p><p>Instead, look at the credentials for whom you are entrusting your treatment. You can find information from the American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (link below) regarding members when searching for a provider near you.</p><p>In the end, if you are treated individually with the correct number of units placed in the right locations by a well trained and experienced provider, you will be happier.
