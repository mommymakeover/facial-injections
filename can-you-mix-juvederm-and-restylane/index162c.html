<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>You will have no problem combining Restylane and Juvederm, both hyaluronic acids, in the same area. (Richard W. Fleming, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Restylane and Juvederm are both hyaluronic acid, just manufactured by different companies (Medicis and Allergan, respectively). Restylane was FDA approved in 2003, Juvederm was FDA approved in 2006. There is no reason why you cannot switch from one to the other.</p><p>The products may last different amounts of time once injected, however this can also be influenced by the skill / technique of the injector, the locations being treated and variability from patient to patient. (Craig S. Rock, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Restylane and Juverderm Use in the Same Area.</b></p><p>You can have Restylane treatment in and ares that has previously been treated with Juvederm and vice versa. They are both hyaluronic acids. Cross linking is what makes them different. There should be no problem combining the two.

</div><p>Sure, soft tissue fillers can be combined in augmenting the face. There’s no reason that you can’t add Juvederm into an area that previously had Restylane injected. (Francis R. Palmer, III, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Restylane and Juvederm combination</h3><p>Both Restylane and Juvederm are hyaluronic acids, with slight differences and manufactured by two different companies. There would be absolutely no contraindication to having one rather than the other. Restylane is now running a special promotion with a $50 rebate, until the end of the year, so if you’ve had Juvederm and Restylane is more cost effective, you could definitely have whichever you prefer. (Robert L. Kraft, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>No problem mixing fillers</b></p><p>You should have no problem using Restylane after having used Juvederm, even in same area. I very commonly use much more different fillers with one another as they all have different positive attributes. Radiesse and Perlane are firmer and I will often layer softer filler such as Restylane over one of them.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2330" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I have used Juvedern in areas with Restylane many times as I do prefer Rerstylane for most things and often have patients that already have Juvederm in place but want more filler. (Jo Herzog, MD, Birmingham Dermatologist)</p><p>Yes, you can treat areas that have been previously treated with another filler. But yes, you can get Restylane if you’ve had Juvederm. (F. Victor Rueckl, MD, Las Vegas Dermatologist)</p><p>It is perfectly safe to add Juvederm to lips that already have Restylane. (Michael A. Persky, MD, Encino Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Safe to use Juvederm with Restylane in same area</i></p><p>There is no contraindication to using Restylane and Juvederm Ultra in the same area. Both are hyaluronic acid fillers and are safe when used together. I believe the lumps in your lips are a result of the injection technique and not the actual product. (Felix Kuo, MD, Long Island Dermatologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2331" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Can I have Restylane if I had Juvederm?</h3><p>Yes, it is like drinking Coke after Pepsi. They are both similar products from different manufacturers so they have some differences. Restylane and Perlane are thicker and better for sculpting and lifting whereas Juvederm is smoother.</p><p>However, there is no reason you can not have both. (Kenneth Beer, MD, Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Both Restylane and Juvederm are hyaluronic acid (HA) based fillers, so though there are some differences they should not be incompatible. One thing I definitely do not recommend is using an HA filler with a different type in the same area. (Richard Baxter, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are absolutely no incompatibility issues with these two products. Mixing them is just not a problem. (Kenneth D. Steinsapir, MD, Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2332" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Filler combinations</h3><p>It is very common to use different fillers in similar regions. It should not be a problem to do so especially with hyaluronic acids. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I’ve combined several fillers in different combinations – there should be no problem. (Laura E. Skellchock, MD (in memoriam), Boca Raton Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Juvederm Vs Restylane</h4><p>I personally carry both products in our practice. Both of them work great but there are a few area’s I may prefer to use one or the other product over. Facial plastic surgeon’s are skilled so they can direct you in which product would work best for the area of concern.</p><p>I have found every patient varies with results of lasting longer then the other. It all depends on how your body breaks the product down. I highly recommend you see a facial plastic surgeon for your evaluation so that you can find the product that works best for you and the area of concern. (Kristin J. Tarbet, MD, FACS, Bellevue Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2333" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Both are Hyaluronic Acid based fillers and hence will dissolve over 12 months and they are very similar in their effects. Juvederm has a few longer lasting products such as Ultra Plus and Voluma that can be used in different areas and last longer. (Naveen Somia, MBBS, PhD, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>We have used both products in our office with excellent success. There are both FDA approved Fillers used for the face. They are both Hyaluronic acid compounds that are well-tolerated in the face. Both products seem to last approximately the same amount of time in our experience. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Restylane and Juvederm are similiar products therefore, yield similar results. What you need to take into account is where the product is being injected and who is injecting the product. However, both products are safe and have proven to show amazing, natural results in my practice. (Daniel J. Ritacca, MD, Chicago Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2334" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In our experience both last the same amount of time both of them are great fillers. We prefer Juvederm for lip injections. (Jhonny Salomon, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The difference between Juvederm and Restylane is in the size of the particles. Both are hyaluronic acid but the Restylane compound is thinner than the Juvederm. Restylane would be used in a more superficial or thin area of skin and Juvederm might be used in a thicker area.</p><p>However, Juvederm can be diluted for specific uses in the face. (Paul Vitenas, Jr., MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Both Juvederm and Restylane are made from hyaluronic acid, both products are very similar in design, and both will produce very similar results. Individual results may vary slightly and different patients will have their own preference for one or the other, but in my experience they are very comparable products that give equally great results. (Jeffrey W. Hall, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2335" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><em>Juvederm vs Restylane: Differences, Similarities and You</em></p><p>Juvederm and Restylane are in a category known as hyaluronic acid fillers. These are substances that are well tolerated and reversible after injection. There are minor differences between the two products as well as a longer clinical result with Juvederm (9-12 months vs 6-9 months).</p><p>Each of these products create excellent results and are similar in pricing. There are, of course, company incentives for physicians and patients alike, so be certain to ask. In clinical application the Juvederm product is more forgiving in comparison to other HA’s and may account for more widespread use.</p><p>Restylane has less of a “smoothing” property due to less dispersion, but also does not harbor the complications of displacement. Like anything, the desired goals determine the means in which they are achieved. Each product has a specific and general use.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2336" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There is certainly overlap in treatment, but in more advanced techniques the differences can be exploited for aesthetic benefits. (James M. Ridgway, MD, FACS, Bellevue Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>We use both Juvederm and Resytylane but prefer using Juvederm as it does seem to last a bit longer. Remember, there’s no inherent magic of any filler be it Juvederm or Restylane. The magic comes from the MD understanding the proper aesthetics of facial beauty and using the filler in the right place and amount to create a naturally, more attractive face through facial shaping and contouring. (Francis R. Palmer, III, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Ask your injector which of the two products they are most comfortable with, and which one they prefer. Most do have a preference. They are comparable, and often each manufacturer does have incentives on the pricing af a syringe.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2337" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I do think Restylane can feel slightly more grainey and lumpy if not done correctly. (Joseph Serota, MD, Aurora Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Juvederm and Restylane are both Hyaluronic acid products, which occurs naturally in our interstitial tissues. They are both safe and reliable with similar results and longevity. Juvederm is made by Allergan (think Botox) and Restylane is made by Medicis.</p><p>Both companies are US based and reputable. Use which ever product your doctor is most comfortable handling. (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Both work, but there are differences.</h4><p>Juvederm and Restylane are both good products. Studies can be found showing longer lasting results for both Restylane and Juvederm. Preferences really depend on the patient, the surgeon and the location of injection. In my own personal experience, I have found that Juvederm is a little softer product and seems to go in a little easier.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2338" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-992609270e15a3489b1d710341d52188">

</div><p>In terms of longevity, I have seen differences depending on the location and on the patient. In general, I do prefer Juvederm because of its ease of injection and its use in multiple areas. I do find Juvederm to be really the best filler for the lips because of its soft nature and lower incidence of bruising, swelling and lumpiness.</p><p>On the flip side, Restylane can be a better choice in the eye area as it is less hydrophilic (water absorbing) and causes less unwanted swelling. Choice of fillers depends on a variety of factors and the first place to start is a consultation with your facial plastic surgeon or dermatologist. (Mark Hamilton, MD, Indianapolis Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I do think that Juvederm is a bit easier to work with, and it seems that sentiment has been echoed by some of my colleagues here. I think above all, the key is to have a practioner with an aesthetic eye, who is able to really understand what you want.</p><p>You also might have to be willing to get more Juvederm (pay more) than you intend depending on what the doctor thinks. The worst thing is to under-correct and not have the result that you really, really want.</p><p>Of course, some of my patients want even more correction, as the results can be dramatic and highly satisfying. They are amazing products, hyaluronic acid fillers. (Srdjan Ostric, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Choose a doctor, not the product!</h4><p>The most important factor in getting good results is not which product to use, but which doctor is injecting it. Both products are safe and effective and in my office cost the same. I use both, but tend to use Juvederm more often for these reasons:</p><ol>
<li>Juvederm typically lasts a little longer (“up to a year,” per the labeling). My patients’ feedback indicates this as well. Juvederm has a higher concentration of hyaluronic acid.</li>
<li>Juvederm tends to be a little smoother in my opinion. If a patient specifically wants Restylane, no problem, but if they aren’t sure I usually go with Juvederm. (Daniel Yamini, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</li>
