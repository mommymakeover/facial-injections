<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Botox can be used to soften the appearance of lines and wrinkles that deepen with expression. These include the horizontal lines of the forehead, the frown lines between brows and the smile lines (crows feet) on the sides of the eyes.</p><p>They typically last 3-4 months. Fillers on the other hand is very effective at filling in the lines or shadows when you are not expressing yourself. </p><p>They can also be used to shape and lift the face.</p><p>I would recommend that you visit with at board certified plastic surgeon or dermatologist in your area to discuss your treatment options so they can be taylored to your concerns and goals.

</div> Botox and fillers treat different issues. The wrinkles formed by active motion such as crow’s feet and vertical lines between the eyebrows are best treated with Botox.
<p>The more stationary lines and depressions are improved by “filling” them with any one of the fillers. </p><p>Usually different fillers are better suited for one part of the face over other fillers. I often use Restylane in the tear trough and cheeks.</p><p>I prefer Juvederm for the lower face and lips. Fillers will usually yield good results for 6 to 12 months depending on the type of filler used, the location of placement and the amount injected. (James R. Gordon, MD, FACS, FAAO, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p> Botox, Dysport and Xeomin work by stopping repeated muscle action at the site of injection. These treatments are very useful for lines and wrinkles that occur due to repetitive motion (specifically, the crows feet, “11” lines between the eyebrows, forehead lines and sometimes lip lines).<br>

</div>Fillers, on the other hand, are best used for lines or folds that occur at rest, and can also be used to rejuvenate areas of lost volume. 
<p>Both can be part of a well-crafted plan to enhance different areas of the face.</p><p>An experienced facial plastic surgeon can explain which areas would be best treated with either Botox or fillers and can give you an idea of the risks and side effects. Generally speaking, however, both Botox and fillers are commonly used by millions of patients and have been studied extensively.</p><p>The key is to have your treatments performed by an expert facial plastic surgeon who understands the underlying anatomy. (Anita Sethna, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox to crow’s feet, glabella, and forehead lines can be indicated. Fillers can be used to the tear trough, nasolabial folds, marionette lines, paralabial lines, among others. (Kenneth B. Hughes, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<strong>Botox and fillers for dynamic and static wrinkles, respectively</strong><p>Botox is for dynamic wrinkles. Facial fillerrs are for static wrinkles, not related to facial muscle contractions or facial expressions and smiles, frowns, etc. Each fulfill a different problem. </p><p>You need to see someone who has expertise in both Botox (Dysort, etc) and facial fillers (Radiesse, Juvederm, Restylane, etc) as each serves a different purpose in rejuvenating the face. (Hratch Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Buffalo Phlebologist)</p><p>Botox and fillers each act differently, and are best suited for different areas. Botox is derived from Botulinum Toxin type A. It paralyzes the muscles in a given area, causing wrinkles to smooth. Fillers such as Restylane and Juvederm are derived from hyaluronic acid, and volumize while filling in wrinkles.</p><p>Botox will last an average of 3 months, and fillers will last around 6-7 months. For the smile lines, or nasolabial folds, Perlane or Radiesse work fantastic. From here, I would recommend a consult with an experienced board certified physician.<br>

</div>He/she will be able to assess your needs and provide you with a recommendation. (Paul S. Nassif, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Botox treats the muscles, fillers provide “fill” or volume. You should have a thorough assessment with a well-trained and experienced injector to discuss all options. (Sam Naficy, MD, FACS, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It all depends on what your goals are and what specific areas are being treated. There is no “best” filler. Each filler has specific indications and pros and cons. Certain wrinkles or lines are better suited to Botox, and certain ones are better suited to fillers.</p><p>You should see a board certified plastic surgeon to discuss all of these issues. It can involve a lengthy discussion which is not possible in this forum. Best, Asif Pirani, MD, FRCS(C). (Asif Pirani, MD, FRCS(C), Toronto Plastic Surgeon)<br>

<b>Which is better, Botox or Fillers?</b><p>Botox and other botulinum toxins are used to reduce movement or dynamic wrinkles, most commonly the frown lines between the eyes, horizontal forehead lines, and Crow’s feet ; less commonly, it is used around the lips to reduce smoker’s lines and elevate the corners of the mouth, or to reduce bunny lines on the nose.</p><p>On the other hand, fillers like Juvederm, Restylane, Perlane, and Radiesse are used to fill areas of volume loss, typically the areas between the nose and mouth (laugh lines/nasolabial folds), or lines between the mouth and chin (Marionette lines) ; fillers can also be nicely used for tear troughs under the eyes, to plump up the cheeks or cheek bones, and to define the jawline.<br>

</div>Speak with your dermatologist about the best options for you, which often involves a combination of Botox and fillers, and sometimes laser resurfacing. (Benjamin Barankin, MD, FRCPC, Toronto Dermatologic Surgeon)
<p>Using one of these or the other is like saying should or buy a bra or socks? Depends on what you want to do. Botox is good to stop making lines that occur with facial motion and expression.</p><p>Fillers help where volume is lost and needs to be added back. Very occasionally both can be used to fix one problem by attacking different causes of that problem. Example: A deep line caused by movement can be improved by stopping the movement but still might need some filler to fill crease that has been in face for many years. (Jo Herzog, MD, Birmingham Dermatologist)<br>

</div> Botox neutralizes muscles of animation and minimise the creases developed with muscle activation. Fillers fill out depressions. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Patients commonly ask whether they would benefit from fillers or Botox. The answer depends on what the problem is and where the problem is. In general, Botox is an upper face treatment, and fillers are a treatment for the mid and lower face.</p><p>There are exceptions to that generality, however. The only way to know what is right for you is to have a consultation with an experienced physician who can assess what your problems and needs are, and together with you formulate a good treatment plan. (Kimberly Finder, MD, San Antonio Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>In regards to Botox and fillers, one is not necessarily better or have less side effects than the other. Botox works best on lines or furrows that are caused from muscular movement, such as on the forehead and around the eyes.<br>

</div>Fillers work best on areas that have lost volume and on lips to make them fuller. Pictures or seeing you in person would be necessary to give you advice as to which would be best for you.
<p>In most cases, for smile lines, fillers would probably work better than Botox. There are several different types of fillers that could last anywhere from a few months to a few years. A consultation with a physician experienced in fillers and Botox would get you more detailed information. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>BOTOX and/or Fillers</b></p><p> BOTOX Cosmetic and dermal fillers act differently. These two products do complement each other very well, however, the roles they play are substantially different. BOTOX Cosmetic is used to relax the muscle, which causes decreased action of the treated muscle resulting in a smooth surface with a reduction of wrinkles.</p><p>On the hand, facial fillers are utilized to add volume to areas of the face that have lost their volume with time. Facial fillers are especially effective around the mouth, lower eyelid, cheek and lip regions.</p><p>As far as fillers, we prefer to use hyaluronic acid fillers and Radiesse. The highest level of aesthetic results can be achieved when BOTOX Cosmetic and facial fillers are used together. (William P. Mack, MD, PA, Tampa Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox & Fillers</em></p><p>Both Botox and fillers are excellent at eliminating lines and wrinkles. This question really emphasizes the importance of a consultation with a board certified specialist and someone who is experienced with both of these products.</p><p>Both of them have a very high level of patient satisfaction and often are used in combination to a greater synergistic effect and more longevity than either can separately. A consultation certainly is needed to determine which product is best suited for you. (Charles M. Boyd, MD, Birmingham Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>The Combo Pack: Botox and Fillers For Facial Rejuvenation</h5><p>Botox and dermal fillers are used in different ways. Botox can lessen movement in more dynamic areas while achieving a more youthful and lifted appearance. Dermal fillers work to restore lost volume to areas of the face while enhancing a patient’s natural facial contours and/or by accentuating certain features.</p><p>Injectors have different preferences for what product they prefer to inject in certain areas of the face to attain specific results. My suggestion is that you visit a board-certified plastic surgeon or dermatologist to learn more about how Botox and dermal fillers can help you achieve the results you are hoping for. (Robert J. Schwartz, MD, Richardson Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>What is the difference between Botox and Fillers</i></p><p>Botox and fillers work very differently. Botox relaxes muscles that can cause facial wrinkles while fillers work to restore volume to an area that is hollowing and possibly has wrinkles as well. Smile lines are most commonly treated with fillers. (Jeffrey M. Joseph, MD, Newport Beach Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox and fillers are used differently, and have their own unique benefits. I would recommend that you consult with a board certified facial plastic surgeon who can assess you and determine what products you are a good candidate for.</p><p>Botox is used to relax overactive muscles which results in smoothing fine lines and wrinkles. Fillers help to replace volume loss and can be used to contour certain facial features. Smile lines often get exaggerated when the cheeks lose volume; I often use Voluma (a facial filler) to address these concerns.</p><p> There are many different types of fillers which all have their own clinical indication. A consultation with a physician will allow you to ask questions and ensure that you get a treatment plan that is completely customized to your specific needs.
