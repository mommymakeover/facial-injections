<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h3>Botox is a quick and simple treatment for the frown lines</h3><p>The ‘angry look’ is the result of vertical lines or ’11’ lines between the eyebrows and a low medial brow.</p><p>The most popular and conservative approach is either Botox or Dysport. Both of these medicines are used to relax the muscles and soften your look.</p><p>Both are safe but temporary and most of my patients return 3-4 months for follow-up treatments. For patients who desire a permanent result, I perform endoscopic brow lift and corrugator myotomy.</p><p>This is an outpatient surgical procedure with little down time. (Randall Latorre, MD, Tampa Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox is your best treatment, but you can also try a filler</strong></p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2759" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Botox is the best treatment for treatment of frown lines between your eyebrows. Altough temporary, it can raise your eyebrows and make you younger looking and more open. (Amir Moradi, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It literally takes 5 minutes to inject you with Botox and given that it will work for 4 months, that’s not too much to fit into a busy schedule if it is important enough to you as it seems that it is.</p><p>Forget about having the muscles cut out and just set aside a few minutes 3 times a year. (Richard P. Rand, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>How to get rid of frown lines on face</strong></p><p>Snarling, ticked-off look is produced by 3 little muscles on the bridge of the nose; The Corrugator muscle pair which pull the inner brows in and down (creating the “11 lines” on your low Forehead) and the Procerus muscles which creates the “Bunny Lines”.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2760" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Botox is BY FAR the easiest and most artistic way to not only smooth frown lines between eyes, but to lift the inner brows (giving your face a calmer, relaxed look). If you are not willing to have that simple procedure 2-3 times a year, you may want to consider having these muscles disrupted surgically.</p><p>They can be reached either through a forehead lift OR by an upper lid lift (Blepharoplasty) incisions. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox is safe and simple</b></p><p>If you are a busy person, Botox is quite simple, quick, and effective. It takes a few minutes. It does require an office visit every 3-4 months, but if you can find someone who runs on time, it is certainly the most effective use of your time compared to a surgical procedure.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2761" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>And it is very safe, especially in the area between the eyes. (Anne Marie McNeill, MD, PhD, Newport Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox or Dysport are quite safe and quick</em></p><p>If you have a hard time fitting in quick Botox or Dysport injections, you probably will have an even harder time fitting in the surgical options. Botox is quite safe. Botox has a long track record of safety and low rate of complications in the area you are asking about.</p><p>I think if you find a provider that you are comfortable with, runs on time, and can accomodate you at shorter notices, you will be quite happy and find it does fit in your busy schedule.</p><p>The actual injection takes but a few seconds. (Vineet Mehan, MD, Washington DC Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2762" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><strong>Alternatives to Botox</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, Botox or Dysport is really the only way to get rid of the frown lines. Most patients require treatment every 3-4 months. I suggest you try a treatment, just once. I believe that when you see the very dramatic result and how great you look, you will feel it is more than worth it to go the doc every 3-4 months to maintain it.</p><p>Also, there is some evidence that patients who have Botox regularly look significantly younger than those who don’t, as they get older. So it has two benefits. (Tracy Pfeifer, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Getting rid of the angry look</h3><p>Maybe a filler like Juvederm or Radiesse if you still have deep frown lines between eyes. Even though you are concerned about the maintenance required since Botox only lasts a few months, consider this… how often do you get your hair done, and how long does it take?</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2763" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Believe me, getting Botox is much faster and typically can be done only every 3-4 months. So consider it maintenance. By the way, fillers like Juvederm or Radiesse last longer than Botox, so they don’t need to be reinjected as often.</p><p>Although one option is a browlift with disruption of the corrugator muscles (the muscles that cause the angry look), there are issues regarding contour changes and brow position that need to be considered. Have a detailed discussion with your plastic surgeon before embarking on surgery.</p><p>I suggest you at least give Botox a try first. (Douglas J. Mackenzie, MD, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox gives you a refreshed look. It makes you look like you have gone on a vacation. Almost 100 percent of patients come back, because they want to remain looking happy and get away from that angry look. (Norman M. Rowe, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2764" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p><i>Botox great treatment for frown lines</i></p><p>Angry look arises from overaction of muscles that pull the eyebrows down and in. Since botulinum toxin (Botox, Dysport) work by weakening muscles, it is a great treatment for softening that angry look. The toxin works by blocking the signal between the the nerve and muscle for a 3 month period, thus preventing the muscle from contracting and depressing the eyebrows.</p><p>If placed appropriately, Botox is a fabulous sculpting agent, easy to administer, not terribly painful and great option to consider. (Scott M. Goldstein, MD, Philadelphia Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h5>How do I get rid of the frown lines?</h5><p>Stress, aging, and genetics are usually at the root of the problem, where people we interact with ask why we look so mad all the time… Botox and Dysport are extremely effective and safe ways to not only improve this, but also actually prevent the problem from getting worse over time.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2765" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>While I certainly understand visiting your dermatologist or plastic surgeon every few months can be a strain on your already tight schedule (and wallet), I also think that the vast majority of patients would tell you that the time and expense required to have regular Botox or Dysport treatments is well worth it for them.</p><p>This is why patient satisfaction is so very high for these treatments, and why the average patient returns for subsequent treatments over time. My recommendation is for you to try it once- many plastic surgeons and dermatologists will offer reduced fees every now and then for special events- look for one of these events, and give it a try.</p><p>I bet you love your new, non-angry look so much that you end up a regular. (Armando Soto, MD, FACS, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Fixing angry look</strong></p><p>Patients come to our clinic and state, “I have people tell me all the time I look angry!” Want to fix that? We can inject Botox into your glabella area between the eyebrows which will make the muscle immobile for 3 to 4 months! To enhance the look of smooth frown lines you can add a pearl laser treatment. (William J. Hedden, MD, Birmingham Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>No need for the angry look</b></p><p>That are what most people refer to as their “11” lines between eyes. Botox is the most effective treatment for that area. It really only takes about 5 minutes and will last up to 4 to 6 months. Once patients see how great the results are, they make the time.</p><p>We could also do some laser treatments to help stimulate your own collagen but botox is more of the quick fix! (Bruce E. Katz, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Long lasting fix for frown lines between eyes</h4><p>Injectable products like Botox and Dysport are the mainstay for the hyperactive muscle that causes the creases between the eyebrows because they are so quick and effective.</p><p>The only truly long-lasting solution is surgical removval of the muscles, which is typically done as part of a forehead lift.</p><p>It’s probably worth seeing if that is something that would benefit you. I wouldn’t hold your breath for a longer lasting Botox-type drug though; because of the way the drugs work, there doesn’t appear to be a way to make thme last longer.
