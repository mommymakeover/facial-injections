<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Both are great tools for non-surgical rejuvenation. It has always been my opinion that “it is not the filler, it is the Filler”, that makes the difference.</p><p>Therefore, is important to be injected by a board certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon who understands the differences between products, how and where to inject them, and how to manage any complications (although they are rare).</p><p>Restylane and both forms of Juvederm: Ultra and Ultra Plus contain hyaluronic acid, which is found naturally in your skin.</p><p>Hyaluronic acid products are very safe and effective when properly injected. There are differences in the products because of proprietary differences in the manufacturing process.</p><p>Juvederm Ultra is softer, making it superior in the lips. Juvederm Ultra Plus gives an extraordinarily soft lift to cheeks.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2099" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Restylane is a bit stiffer, making it stay in place better, so I like it for an eyebrow lift and to define the lip border (although Comsplast is STILL the best for that).</p><p>Most of my patients have reported Juvederm lasts longer, but some people feel strongly otherwise. If in doubt, try both and see which lasts longer in you.</p><p>After all, every patient is different so it is important to see a doctor who can deliver YOUR best result. “It is not the filler it is the Filler.”. (Mary P. Lupo, MD, New Orleans Dermatologist)</p><p>There are definitely differences between Juvederm and Restylane . In my practice I use these 2 fillers the most. The one similarity is that both are hyaluronic fillers.</p><p>Also, know that there are 2 types of Juvederm – Ultra and Ultra Plus. Because of differences in the way Restylane and Juvederm are produced, they do not have identical properties when placed in the skin.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2100" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>A good analogy is that Restylane fills like “jelly” whereas Juvederm fills like “Jell-o.” An important consideration for me when choosing between the two is, where am I injecting the product?</p><p><em>There will be 3 important differences:</em></p><ol>
<li>How it feels – especially in the lips</li>
<li>The amount of swelling</li>
<li>The size of the needle that can be used, which is especially relevant for correction of orbital hollows. (Felix Kuo, MD, Long Island Dermatologist)</li>
</ol><p><b>Juvederm versus Restylane – get your doctor’s opinion!</b></p><p>Both of these products are excellent products, and like many of the other physicians in this forum, I use both. Both manufacturers try to convince physicians and patients that their own product is best, but they both DO have a role.</p><p>Because I am at an academic medical center, I tend to give lots of lectures. One of the points in one of my lectures is that one of the things a patient is seeing from their doctor is an OPINION about what’s best for them.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2101" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>I use the two products for different applications and also interchangably for certain applications. But, I’d rather have a patient come in and help me understand what facial changes related to aging that they want me to assess and “correct” then allow me to make a recommendation and explain why I made the recommendation THAN have someone come in and tell me they “want Juvederm” or that they “want Restylane”.</p><p>Rather than having a preconceived notion of “what you want”, see what your doctor recommends and WHY he or she recommends a particular product. (David W. Stepnick, MD, Cleveland Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>I use both and really don’t see a difference</em></p><p>I have been injecting both of these fillers for years and truthfully don’t appreciate any difference. Both are easy to use and get me the results I want for my patients. Ignore the advertising and go with whatever your surgeon wants you to have. (Phillip C.

</div><p><strong>Juvederm vs Restylane: Ask for a “Core Trained” Physician</strong></p><p>As has been well described on this topic, Restylane and Juvederm are both FDA approved forms of injectable Hyaluronic acid. I have used both extensively in my practice and see very little difference between them, having obtained excellent results with both.</p><p>What is most critical is that you see a Physician trained and qualified to perform the procedure: A Facial Plastic Surgeon, Plastic Surgeon, Occuloplastic Surgeon or Dermatologist. I can assure you that your average family Physician, Radiologist, or Ob/Gyn have no meaningful training in facial aesthetics. (Stephen Prendiville, MD, Fort Myers Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Many Surgeons like myself do complimentary consultations and the best thing to do is make a consultation appointment and discuss the differences with your physician. I personally use Juvederm in some areas and Restylane in other areas on the same patient.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2103" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>It depends on each patients needs and areas od concern. Both of the products are made of hyaluronic acid which is a naturally occurring substance in the body.</p><p>I probably use three times the amount of Juvederm in my practice compared to Restylane because Juvederm comes in two forms the ultra and the ultra plus.</p><p>The ultra injectable gel is formed for versatility in contouring and volumizing wrinkles and folds while the ultra plus formulation for volumizing and correcting deeper wrinkles and folds.</p><p>The Hylacross technology in juvederm creates a high degree of cross-linking which promotes the duration of the product sometimes up to six months or longer. (Michael Elam, MD, Orange County Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>To some degree, the difference between Juvederm and Restylane depends who you’re seeing</h3><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2104" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>As the other authors have noted, the two products are similar in composition – both being hyaluronic acid. Juvederm is made by Allergan, the same people who make breast implants, so it may be more common in a plastic surgeon’s office.</p><p>Medicis, the manufacturer of Restylane, seems to have better visability among dermatologists so it may be in some cases, their drug of choice. All this will likely change once Dysport, the Medicis version of Botox, is released later this year. (Robert Frank, MD, Munster Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Juvéderm and Restylane are similar</h4><p>Juvéderm and Restylane are similar hyaluronic acid fillers, and both are effective. The main difference is that Juvéderm generally lasts longer and has a smoother consistency. The most important thing is to choose an experienced, professional doctor who can tell you which product would best meet your needs.

</div><p><em>Juvederm versus restylane</em></p><p>The first thing to know is that there are no truly valid scientific studies directly comparing one product to the other. Therefore, which one is better is more a personal preference and “opinion” of the injector based on their past experiences.</p><p>Both products have lots of good clinical evidence to support their use and both have a few product variations to help treat different areas on the face. I have had good reliable, reproducible results that are fairly long lasting with Juvederm and that is why I chose to use that product.</p><p>The training and skill of the injector are the most important variables to consider when choosing a product. You should first concentrate on finding a skilled trained board certified surgeon who does the injections. You should be able to meet with them and form a good relationship.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2106" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>They should be able to examine you and find out which areas you are the most interested in treating and then you should be able to trust their recommendations based on your discussion. I would encourage you to not look at this as a one time intervention, but as the start of a relationship that you will have with a great doctor for years to come.</p><p>The good news is that there is no really wrong answer except to choose someone who is not well trained and friendly. (Jonathan Amspacher, MD, Kansas City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Although similar in chemical structure, there are difference between these to HA fillers, in terms of their longevity, hydrophillicity (water retention).</p><p>I use both fillers depending on the location where the filler is applied. (Chang Son, MD, Englewood Dermatologist)</p><p>Both Juvederm and Restylane are hyaluronic acid soft tissue fillers. This is a naturally occurring material found in the supporting tissues of our bodies. There are several varieties of both fillers but i have not found any significant difference between the two brands.</p><p>Your best result will be obtained by having a well trained, experienced physician perform your injections with the material they think will provide the longest lasting and most appropriate result. (Andrew Goldberg, MD, Fairfax Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Both Juvederm and Restylane are hyaluronic acid fillers. The main difference is that Juvederm is blended to create one molecular consistency, whereas Restylane is groups of HA molecules are formed into particles. Restylane draws in more water that Juvederm for this reason and can sometimes create more swelling.</p><p>I haven’t seen any differences with respect to spread of the product. Juvederm does have an indication for up to a year, whereas Restylane is 6-9 months. (Derek Norcom, MD, Portland Physician)</p><p>By now there are so many injectable filler products on the market it may get confusing for the patient and consumer to navigate among them. Juvederm and Restylane are both made of hyaluronic acid (a naturally occurring substance that normally lives in our bones and joints).</p><p>They each now have variations on themselves : Voluma, Volbella, Volure, Restylane silk, Restylane lyft . the list goes on.</p><p>These fillers are all FDA tested and when used carefully and correctly are safe to inject and can create impressive aesthetic enhancement to one’s appearance.</p><p>Because they each have subtle characteristic differences, it is important to find a board certified doctor who is familiar with the products to guide you in what is the best product for you and the goals you hope to achieve.
