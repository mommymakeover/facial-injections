<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><i>Botox activation time</i></p><p>Typically you will see Botox results within 3 to 7 days. If you see no difference in two weeks, then make an appointment to get evaluated. If you need close to immediate results you may want to try a product called Dysport. (Bruce E. Katz, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>When will you notice the Botox results?</em></p><p>Botox Cosmetic is a fabulous wrinkle remover – working on frown lines, forehead wrinkles, and those pesky “11”s. The beauty of Botox is that is has relatively few side effects and requires almost no down-time.</p><p>You may head back to work and all normal activities that afternoon.</p><p>The one thing to avoid is massaging the Botox injection area, as this can make the Botox migrate to unintended muscles. Any side effects such as redness, bruising, or pain at the injection site, should be mild and disappear in a couple of days.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3221" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Some people will notice tiny results from their Botox Cosmetic treatments immediately, but most results take closer to 2 weeks before they start to appear. The paralyzing component of Botox does need a bit of time to get going.</p><p>Even at 2 weeks post-treatment, know that the optimal results from Botox will continue filling in for up to 8 weeks. After 4-6 months, you will notice that results are beginning to fade, making it time for a repeat treatment.</p><p>SO . give your face about 10-12 more days before you give up on the Botox results ! (Narin (Joe) Apisarnthanarax, MD, Houston Dermatologist)</p><p><strong>Botox kicks in in 4-7 days.</strong></p><p>Botox is not as fast at kicking in as dysport is. Regular botox takes 4-7 days to kick in whereas dysport does it in 2-3 days. (David Hansen, MD, Beverly Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3222" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-0bd9af67fa10f450931b6e2bee317cc2">

</div><p><i>When will the results of Botox be noticeable?</i></p><p>The effects of Botox placed in the muscle usually has an effect starting on day 2 and the maximum affect is at about day 7.</p><p>After day 7, if you are not seeing any results, then another appointment with your injector is in order, to make sure you don’t have antibodies to the Botox product, and to make sure the product was placed in the correct muscle. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox Effects</em></p><p>The effects of botox are visualized in 4-7 days after the procedure. Patients with deeper lines may notice a partial reduction in lines with a first time treatment. As patients become consistent users of botox, they may notice lines becoming smoother and smoother.</p><p>With consistent use of botox, dynamic lines are expected to be completely effaced. (Anil R. Shah, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3223" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-786f37e2dcabe0adfd2b6382831f14c7">

</div><p><i>Botox effects. When do they start?</i></p><p>Our office tells patients that it will be about four days before they see the effects of Botox treatment. Good effect is usually seen around 10-14 days.</p><p>Each patient is different. If still no effect after giving it some tine, call your injector. (Jeffrey J. Roth, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Results of Botox can take a few days</i></p><p>Botox can take several days to “check in”so if you don’t see anything after two days please do not worry. The full effect can take up to two weeks in some patients. If you still don’t see anything after two weeks then you should return to your treating physician.</p><p>I have all of my Botox patients return in two weeks to do a “Botox check” to make sure they are happy with the results.

Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3224" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-ba102a33119689a43842b0af9a9f4c6b">

</div><p>The effects of a Botox injection will manifest to its maximum strength in 2 weeks and will last for 3 – 4 months. With regularly scheduled treatments the onset may become shorter and the duration longer. (Thomas Guillot, MD, Baton Rouge Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It usually takes 4 to 7 days for Botox to work. You should start seeing results soon. If for some reason you feel like you need a touch up, give it 2 to 3 weeks before having more injected.</p><p>Consult with your Board Certified Plastic Surgeon as to the results you should expect. (Robert E. Zaworski, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox results seen in 4-5 days</strong></p><p>You will see the results of Botox in 4-5 days. It will peak in 21 days and wear off in 90 days. (David Finkle, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3225" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><i>Botox may take up to 2 weeks to see results</i></p><p>Botox may take up to 2 weeks to see results. Although you may start seeing results in a few days. As an example, for me personally, my Botox treatment doesn’t even start to kick in until 7-10 days.</p><p>After 2 weeks if the results are not perfect, I tell my patients to return for more. The goal in my practice is to customize everyone’s goal and therefore we work UP to the perfect dose if needed.</p><p>Once a dose is customized, with or without a touchup (if needed), we usually continue with that same dose for future appointments, for consistent “perfect”results. (Lorrie Klein, MD, Laguna Niguel Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox onset of action…give it time</em></p><p>Botox really starts to maximally work at 7-10 days. (Chris Thiagarajah, MD, Denver Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3226" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><em>Botox onset usually after 3 days</em></p><p>Usually, you will see the results of your Botox injections after 2-3 days. If you still do not see any results after 1 week, call your practitioner and request to evaluate the results using before and after pictures. (Harold J. Kaplan, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Noticing BOTOX results</em></p><p>BOTOX results typically show up 3-10 days after treatment. Every person responds differently, but I generally advised waiting up to 2 weeks to see the maximal response — at this point I have patients return to see if we have the right dose for them. (Benjamin Barankin, MD, FRCPC, Toronto Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>Noticing the Botox results</h5><p>The effect of Botox is SLOWER in coming on than Dysport. It begins around 48-72 hours after injection and will maximize by 5-7 days. In a week’s time or so you will the full effect. (Peter A. Aldea, MD, Memphis Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3227" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><strong>Botox: As Early as 24 hours, as Late as 2 weeks</strong></p><p>I have seen patients respond as soon as 24 hours and as late as 2 weeks. The average patient takes 3 days. Therefore, I counsel patients that a 3-7 day lag is expected before any benefit is appreciable.</p><p>The peak effect from Botox is expected at 1 month. Dysport has shown data that it may take effect earlier than Botox, and I have seen relatively early responses with it. However, have not seen patients requesting it for that reason. (Stephen Prendiville, MD, Fort Myers Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox can take several days to see the results</em></p><p>Although most patients start to see Botox results 2-3 days after treatment, in a few patients it can take as long as 7 days to see initial results. Although none of us are patient by nature, give it a few more days to work.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3228" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If you still don’t notice any improvement, let your doctor know!. (Sam Jejurikar, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox may take two weeks</h3><p>Although most patients starting seeing the effects of botox in a couple days it can take as long as two weeks.</p><p>If a patient has an event coming up in a couple days I like to use Dysport since it has a quicker onset of action,. (Patricia Farris, MD, Metairie Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>In a study, it was shown that the average for Botox is four days. That means some people must wait longer..even up to two weeks. If you do not have an effect at that time, you might have been injected with bad Botox.</p><p>However, be patient. Incidentally, Dysport, Botox’s rival, seems to have a slightly earlier effect: average 3 days. (Arnold R. Oppenheim, MD, Virginia Beach Dermatologist)</p><p><em>Botox Impact</em></p><p>The time that Botox takes before it becomes noticeable from patient to patient is generally 4 -7 days. If you do not observe a difference after 7 days, I would suggest that you call the physician to have him recheck you.</p><p>He/she can generally inject more units if needed. (Kris M.

</div><p>Generally, I find that Botox takes full effect within 48-72 hours after injection. In many cases, I have treated patients who have been dissatisfied by previous Botox injections by another practitioner, with the most-common complaint being that “it didn’t work” or “it didn’t last”.</p><p>The common denominator in these situations is that the patients were treated “by area”, and had no idea how many units of Botox were used. Like any other medication, Botox should be administered in a recognized and standardized dosing form.</p><p>Some medications are administered by grams, milligrams, or ounces; Botox is administered by “units”. When properly diluted and prepared for injection, the physician should know precisely how many “units” of Botox are contained in 1cc of solution.</p><p>That way, when for example the “11’s” or frown lines are treated with 20 units in 1cc, both the doctor and the patient know what dose was used. In my office, Botox is charged to the patient at $15 per unit.</p><p>If the dose was effective (as it usually is) for a given area, both I and the patient know how much of a dose will be required at the next visit, and what the cost will be.</p><p>Many offices do Botox treatments “by area”, meaning that the patient is charged a fee for the frown lines, another fee for the crow’s feet, and another fee for the forehead, as examples. In this scenario, the office may be charging the patient much more than $15 per unit, since the dilution of the Botox as it is prepared is generally much greater than 20 units per 1cc.</p><p>The office makes a greater profit per vial of Botox, but patients may not receive an effective dose, nor do they know the actual dose they receive. A final factor is the skill of the injector.</p><p>In some cases, the Botox may be administered too superficial or too deep relative to the muscle causing the unwanted frown or wrinkle line, in which case it will be marginally effective. Very rarely, there may be problems with the potency of the medication as received from the manufacturer. (Athleo Louis Cambre, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox takes betwen 4-7 days for it to work. Now, if the lines are deep furrows, they may actually be dermal depression lines that will not completely respond to Botox. Sometimes surgical techniques to release these lines from the undersurface can help.</p><p>Sometimes tiny amounts of injectable fillers or fat grafts can help as well.
