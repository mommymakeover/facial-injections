Most patients begin to see a difference in the first 3-4 days and will see the optimal results about 2 weeks after the injections.</p><p>I usually see patients every 3-4 months for Botox treatments, however each person’s body has a different metabolism which effects how long the product will last. </p><p>I recommend following up with your injecting physician about 3 months after your injections, so that they can assess if you are ready for more.</p><p>Sometimes, I have patients wait another couple of weeks if the Botox hasn’t completely worn off, therefore ensuring that they get the best result possible. </p><p>There is no research that has shown a limit to the amount of times a patient can receive Botox treatments.<br>

</div>As with any injectable product, close follow up with your doctor is always recommended.  (Babak Azizzadeh, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<p><b>Botox effects begin within 24-48 hours</b></p><p>The scientific data says Botox takes effect within 4 days and last around 3-4 months. Since I have had Botox I can tell you within 24 hours you will most likely feel the effects if injections are given in the frown region.</p><p>However, it is dose dependent. Most physicians take into consideration the number of units placed in a specific area. Men require more units especially in the frown region. </p><p>If you are satisfied with the result then you are receiving the correct number of units.</p><p>If you feel there is an under correction then it is a good idea to follow up with the doctor within two weeks to asses your result. A touch up of several units may or may not be necessary.<br>

</div>You can also request photos of the before and after result if they are not done beforehand. Personally, I not only like the results, but I feel that frowning is in itself a form of stress expression and when these muscles relax I get a sense of relief.
<p>Patients have described this to me as well. There is the rare patient who becomes less responsive to Botox even with a greater number of units being used. </p><p>At this point it may be a good idea to switch to Xeomin wihich is also a Botulinium toxin but is formulated differently. (Robert W. Sheffield, MD, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Each patient is different.  Some patients see results in a few days.  Most get results by a week.  However you should wait a full two weeks to be sure that you have gotten the full result.<br>

</div>Different patients need repeat treatments at different intervals.  Most people last 3-4 months between treatments.  Some people last up to about 6 months.  
<p>We have treated patients with Botox for over 20 years.  It is considered safe to get Botox indefinitely, if you would like.</p><p>Generally you do not get “immune” to Botox so usually once you get the right dose for you, the dose rarely changes.  (Marc Cohen, MD, Philadelphia Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>The effects of Botox begin within the first 5 days and you should be satisfied with results within 2 weeks.  I would encourage a follow up appointment if you do not see the desired effects after 2 weeks for a touch-up.</p><p> There is no maximum on how many times you can be injected and the fact is if you are on a regimen of injections every 3 – 4 months over a 2 year period that the muscles that create lines and wrinkles will begin to diminish giving you longer durations between injections. (James Mirabile, MD, FACOG, Overland Park OB-GYN)<br>

</div><h4>Botox works in 3-5 days the first time</h4><p>Botox, in general, begins to work as soon as 3 days. In some individuals they will begin to see the effects in 24 hours whereas others take as long as 2 weeks for the full effect. On average, in our patient population, we’ve seen the Botox take effect between 3-5 days.</p><p>There is no limit to how many times you can get Botox; however, the aging process does continue for all of us and we may have to offer other procedures to you to continue enhancing your upper face as you mature. (Mike Majmundar, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>How long until Botox results are noticable the first time?</h4><p>The full results from Botox Cosmetic injections can take up to 7 days. While some people see some immediate results, this is does not happen in everyone. Usually after 2-3 days, results will begin to show.<br>

</div>You are right, your Botox results will last from about 3-6 months, after which time a repeat treatment will be needed. The paralyzing effect on muscles is only temporary. It is also completely safe for these muscles.
<p>There are no guidelines restricting the number of times you can repeat your Botox injections. In my experience, the longer you continue your regular Botox treatments, you will find yourself needing repeat treatments less often.</p><p>There is some consensus that the muscles in the targeted area will ‘remember’ to stay relaxed. While this may not occur with everyone, just be comforted knowing that there is no upper limit on the amount of Botox injections you can receive. (Narin (Joe) Apisarnthanarax, MD, Houston Dermatologist)</p><p>I find that when I have botox myself, I start noticing subtle changes within hours of injection and the effects increase over the course of the first week. It’s best to give yourself two weeks before determining if you need more. (Keshini Parbhu, MD, Orlando Oculoplastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>It takes about 3 to 5 days to start to see results and 2 weeks to see the full expression of the Botox treatment with a visible reduction in lines and wrinkles. It is best to keep Botox treatments spread out a minimum of 90 days between treatments.
<p>There is not a limit on how many times you get Botox in a lifetime. You can continue receiving Botox treatments throughout your life. (Pooja Malik, MD, Cherry Hill Family Physician)</p><p>Varies per person, but the range is several days to 2 weeks. If no results in two weeks, return to your provider. (Barbara L. Persons, MD, FACS, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You will starting seeing the results of Botox approximately 3 – 5 days after the injections and will see the final results around the 14 day mark. Most patients come back every 3 to 4 months for Botox injections. Studies have shown that it is safe to continue getting Botox injections over long periods of time.<br>

</div>In fact, the longer you get Botox injections, the longer the results will last each time.  (Jimmy S. Firouz, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)
<p><em>When you see Botox results and how long they last</em></p><p>Botox is a purified protein used to address wrinkles associated with facial expression. The pivotal studies on Botox showed the peak effect to be at two weeks. In this study they looked at the effects at two weeks, four weeks, eight weeks, and twelve weeks.</p><p>We find that most patients see results in three to seven days. But it could take up to two weeks to see full results, so it is important to be patients. Most people enjoy the results of their Botox treatment for three to four months.</p><p>But for some people it can be less than two months and I have seen people who enjoy their results for nine months. I have patients who have been having Botox treatments for over ten years without any complications. (Alex Eshaghian, MD, PhD, Encino Physician)</p><h3>Botox in full effect at 2 weeks</h3><p>After your receiving botox injections it can take 3-4 days before you see a difference, it does takes two weeks to see the full effect, so I would recommend waiting the full two weeks if you were wanting to add more units.</p><p>The average patient returns every 3 1/2 – 4 months. We have noticed in our patients that have been using botox consistently that they are using less units and space their treatments further apart. (Patricia Faraz, MD, Ladera Ranch OB-GYN)</p><p>It takes 3-7 days and sometimes up to 2 weeks to see the full effect of a Botox treatment at the first time.  Make sure your injector is properly trained with good experience.  There is no limit to how many treatments or how many years you can get Botox. (Jason Brett Lichten, MD, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox results start appearing the next day after the injectors and more complete results appear in 4-7 days. The best results are evident 2 weeks after an injection. There’s not limit to how long one can keep getting Botox. (Justin Harper, MD, Columbus Physician)</p></div>
