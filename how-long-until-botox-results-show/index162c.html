</div><p>Once these muscles are weakened and relaxed, the fine lines and wrinkles in the skin overlying these muscles should smooth out as well. These results typically last from 2-4 months, and there is no limit to how long you can continue to be treated in the future.</p><p>In fact, after receiving regular Botox injections every few months, some people develop slight muscle atrophy, or decreased size and strength of the treated muscles, which can allow the results of Botox to last a little longer before the return of muscle function becomes evident. (Jordan Cain, MD, Frisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox results usually at 3-5 days, but if result is inadequate wait 2 weeks</h3><p>While the result is usually seen at 3-5 days, final evaluation should wait 14 days. If the result is inadequate: More Botox may be needed if there is still too much voluntary motion</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_146" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

(Nathan Mayl, MD (retired), Fort Lauderdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox results are seen in 5-7 days. The peak effect is seen at 1 month. A gradual return of function is seen at 3-4 months. (Edward J. Gross, MD, Orlando Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox Cosmetic results can generally be seen anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks following treatment. In our experience, the results have a longevity lasting anywhere from 6 weeks to 5 months, depending on several factors which include, but are not limited to, how quickly your body metabolizes the toxin.

</div><p><b>Estimated Time For Botox Results</b></p><p>A patient can see results with Botox anywhere from a few minutes immediately after the injection up to 2 weeks after the injection.</p><p>It really depends how the patient metabolizes the Botox and where the Botox was injected.</p><p>Most patients state that they see their best results 3-4 days after the injection. (Florencia Guzman, MD, West Chester Physician)</p><p><strong>Full Botox benefit at 2 weeks.</strong></p><ol>
<li>1) After Botox injections, you begin to see the result in 2 days, maximum result in 2 weeks, and mostly gone in 4 or 5 months.</li>
<li>2) There are many patients who have had Botox injections for 10 years safely.</li>
<li>3) Result in the neck is seen more quickly. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</li>

</div><p>Botox has a better safety record than Aspirin, but there have been cases where a patient will grow resistant to Botox after repeated use. There is no harmful effects in these cases, just a lack of results. (Harold J. Kaplan, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox can start to work with a few days. I see patients who claim that they can tell its starting to work the next day, and a small number who find it can take nearly two weeks to see the effect, so there is certainly some individual variation.</p><p>I routinely see my new patients for a review two weeks after their first treatment as we can be confident that it is working by then. There is some evidence that by using the treated muscles during the 10 or 15 minutes after treatment the effect may come on more quickly, as this speeds up the uptake of Botox into the nerve ending.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_149" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-4a7b238664083e65d5be4ddbc0d7436e">

Botox has now been is use for long enough to feel confident that repeated use does not appear to cause any problems.</p><p>Although the effect typically lasts 3-4 months for most people, after you have had treatment for a little while you may well find the effect starts to last longer.</p><p>A number of my patients who have been having treatment for a while only need to come every 6 months, and some less often than this.

</div><p><b>Botox results for wrinkles on the face</b></p><p>Botox selectively inhibits acetylcholine release at the neural synapse.</p><p>When injected, the botox binds to the receptor and prevents the release of acetylcholine. However, there is still remaining acetylcholine that has already been released. It takes about 5 days for the remaining acetylcholine to be used up. So, it takes about 5 days for the effects to take effect. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>For most patients, the effects of Botox become apparent in terms of diminished muscle activity within 2-3 days. The effects gradually wear off over the following 2-3 months, and generally there is no residual muscle paralysis after 3-4 months.</p><p>For this reason, most patients return every 3-4 months for re-treatment. Some patients seem to require less Botox at subsequent treatments, perhaps because there is some muscle atrophy as a result of loss of nerve stimulus due to the Botox.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_151" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There is no limit as to how long a patient can continue to receive Botox treatments. (Athleo Louis Cambre, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox blocks the contraction of muscles. Once injected you will start to see results in as little as 2-3 days but it will continue to work for up to 2 weeks. Botox will typically start to wear off at 3-4 months.</p><p>Depending on age, amount used, exercise regimen you may choose to have the injection every 3 months or every 6 months. Many use Botox as a preventive measure or as a treatment. Many people are still injecting into their 60 and 70âs.

</div><p>Our office typically performs between 70-80 injections per month and this is a very common question. The onset of the medication usually is after 4-5 days, and takes about 10 days to get the maximum effect.</p><p>Based on our expertise, we often suggest a certain amount of botox to help the patient get the results they seek, and if the patient gets the recommended dosage, we offer additional botox in the first month if the medication fails to achieve the desired results.</p><p>So if after the first two weeks the results are not exceeding your expectations we will make it right. It is important to ask your provider what their policy is for those rare occasions where you are not fully satisfied. (Manish Raj Gupta, MD, Toledo Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most of the activity of Botox in softening lines of expression is seen in the first 2-4 days after injeclion. There may be some additional activity for the next week, so patients can get their results evaluated 2 weeks after injection.</p><p>Patients can get Botox injected every 4 months or when muscle activity returns. There is no limit to how long one can keep getting Botox. (Sanjay Mukerji, MD, Thousand Oaks Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
