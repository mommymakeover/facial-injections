</div><p>Your doctor will be able to decide which is the best choice for you depending on what areas of the face you are having treated. (Ritu Saini, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Juvederm may last longer than Restylane</h3><p>Juvederm and Restylane are very safe and powerful facial fillers that are composed of a substance known as hyaluronic acid. This is a substance that is synthetically formulated and that has a very low allergenic profile.</p><p>The difference between the two products arises from the amount of cross linking of the hyaluronic acid. The more cross linking, the longer the product lasts. Juvederm has 10% more cross linking and thus may last longer than Restylane.</p><p>Restylane and Juvederm are safe injectables for use in the nasolabial folds, lips, and soft tissues of the face and hands. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Juvederm vs. Restylane</h4><p></p>

</div>Both are very safe, effective, and similar in cost. They are both formulations of hyaluronic acid which a clear gel like substance that is found normally in your joint cartilage and is also an important component of normal youthful skin that diminishes with age.
<p>In our experience Juvederm seems to last a bit longer. Restylane can be a bit more “form stable” making it a good choice for areas where millimeters count, like the tear trough. Most hyaluronic acid based fillers can be expected to last around 9-12 months.</p><p>It really depends on the amount and the area injected. Injections should always be performed by a skilled, experienced, board certified core aesthetic provider (Plastic Surgeon, Dermatologist) or a nurse injector working in the office of a board certified core provider.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1973" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It’s a plus if the surgeon is also a member of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, a very selective organization that indicates a higher standard of aesthetic surgical training and expertise. It’s important that they listen and pick what’s right for treatment area. (Marco Ellis, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Juvederm and Restylane are both excellent hyaluronic acid fillers</b></p><p>Juvederm and Restylane are hyaluronic acid fillers made by two different companies. They have different fill profiles and neither is better in all cases than the other. I use both in my practice and prefer Restylane in some areas of the face and Juvederm in others.</p><p>In general, Juvederm seems to last a little longer than Restylane, but gives more fill and so can be too much for delicate areas with thin skin. Also, the products last differently in different patients, there is a lot of individuality in this.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1974" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Choose a physician who uses several of these products and ask him or her which is recommended for your needs and why. (Elizabeth Slass Lee, MD, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Over the past decade I have used Restylane and Juvederm extensively and I have found that Juvederm is my favorite family of fillers. They’re both hyaluronic acid based and they both give great results. Juvederm does tend to last a bit longer in my experience, up to a year.</p><p>In fact, I have some patients in whom it lasts even longer. Always keep in mind that the most important aspect of having fillers done is the skill of the injector, their artistry and their knowledge of anatomy.</p><p>Be sure to visit an expert in facial aesthetics to maximize your results and minimize any side effects. (Peterson Pierre, MD, Thousand Oaks Dermatologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1975" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h5>Making a decision between juvederm and restylane</h5><p>When you examine published studies of filler longevity, Juvederm ultra, Juvederm ultra plus, Restylane and Restylane Lyft all last the same length of time and all have similar FDA label for how long they last.</p><p>The only hyaluronic acid that can advertise a longer length of time on its FDA label is Juvederm Voluma. That makes sense because the manufacturing process for Voluma uses very different cross linking. But you have to take the longevity information with a grain of salt.</p><p>In the USA the labelling comes from studies on different parts of the face so you aren’t always comparing apples and apples (pardon the pun — voluma advertising initially incorporated an apple like the apple of the cheek).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1976" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>There may also be differences in how an individual patient metabolizes one or another line of fillers. Filler will never last as long in an area with stronger or busier muscles. Products that are injected more deeply often last longer.</p><p>Different products are designed to be injected higher or lower or in one area of the face or another based on how they hold up to gravity, their softness, moldability and appearance. Discuss with your physician what your goals are for filler.</p><p>She can then discuss the best fillers for your needs. (Heidi A. Waldorf, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h3>Juvederm may last a bit longer</h3><p>These products are very similar in composition and what you can achieve with their use. I often use more Juvederm in practice because I like the product better and find that it lasts a bit longer than Restylane.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1977" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Both products can be used for similar things. I would suggest more important than the product is the injectors technical skill at achieving the results you want. It is important to remember that sufficient amounts of product must be placed to achieve the desired results. (Sameer Bashey, MD, Beverly Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Juvederm and Restylane both have a role as fillers</b></p><p>Personally, I use both products. I prefer Juvederm in the lips for most patients since it is softer and more natural. I use Restylane more often for nasolabial folds although Radiesse is my favorite filler for nasolabial folds.</p><p>Many of my patients still prefer Restylane for their lips. I think that Juvederma and Restylane last a similar amount of time and some patients find one lasts longer than the other. Each patient has different needs and we customize our choices according to how much enhancements and fullness they are trying to achieve.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1978" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>We will use new fillers and combine them to soften and fill the lines of the face. (Brenda Dintiman, MD, Fairfax Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Juvederm lasts longer.</h3><p>As usual with plastic surgery procedures, all is relative. If you are looking for longevity, Juvederm lasts a bit longer than the other Hyaluronic acid-based products. It also costs quite a bit more. I am not so enamoured by facial fillers as I think in many cases we go too far, but that is just my own opinion. (John P. Di Saia, MD, Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Juvederm and Restylane are both FDA approved hyaluronic acid fillers and are used in the same way. It really depends on patients preference and cost. Juvederm is usually slightly more expensive. I use more Restylane in my practice, primarily due to the cost and I find the product to be slightly longer lasting. (Alfred Sofer, MD, FACS, Fairfield Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>We now have several fillers available that have unique features that make them more suitable for specific problems and areas. Juvederm Ultra and Restylane have approximately the same duration of effect.</p><p>Juvederm Ultra Plus provides longer correction. Juvederm Volume is the longest-lasting of the trio of “Juvederm” products. The most important choice that you can make is the doctor who treats your cosmetic issues. An experienced, knowledgeable board-certified physician whose primary focus is cosmetic treatments can determine which filler is most suitable for specific problems. (Renuka Diwan, MD, Cleveland Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Juvederm vs. Restylane: Which is “Better?”</h3><p>Both of these products are comprised of hyaluronic acid. Both are safe and effective. Juvederm tends to last longer than Restylane. Juvederm has a higher concentration of hyaluronic acid compared to Restylane. Both products last longer in areas that are not as mobile (e.g., cheeks) compared to those areas that are very mobile (e.g., lips). Juvederm tends to be smoother when injected and appears as such under the microscope when compared to Restylane. Juvederm has slightly less product in each syringe compared to Restylane.</p><p>Lastly, there is an option to purchase a smaller syringe of Restylane which is not currently available with Juvederm. At present, neither of these products currently comes pre-mixed with local anesthetic, though this will likely change in the near future.</p><p>The skill of the physician who is injecting the material is the most important factor to consider. Make sure your physician has the proper training, credentials, and experience. It is of the utmost importance to communicate your goals to your physician.</p><p>This will allow your physician to meet and exceed your expectations. (Adam Schaffner, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Both are very good products. It appears that in scientific studies, Juvederm may last longer than restylane. I prefer Juvederm for this reason as well as for the ease with which I can inject the product. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
