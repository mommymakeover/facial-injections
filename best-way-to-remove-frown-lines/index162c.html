<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Botox is used to smooth the deep, persistent facial lines between the eyebrows, frown lines, crow’s feet, horizontal lines across the foreheard, worry lines around the mouth and lines on the neck.</p><p> This will relax the muscles that cause the wrinkles, thus smoothing the line that makes you look angry or tired.  You will have a more youthful and rejuvenated look. (Kevin Tehrani, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox Not Enough for Deep Glabellar Lines, Restylane necessary</strong></p><p>Botox or Dysport alone will probably be very underwhelming.  Those treatments will stop you from making the movement of a scowl, but a crease as ingrained as yours will not go away with that alone.</p><p>First, it is true, you will need Botox/Dysport to put the muscle at rest.  This will prevent ongoing damage to the skin and allow some natural correction to occur.  But the natural correction your body does on its own will be far from complete.<br>

</div> A single or perhaps two treatments of an HA filler like Restylane will be necessary to fix that crease.  The HA filler will have an immediate impact on the crease, then over a month or two, the HA will stimulate collagen remodeling which will repair the crease.
<p> Botox and Dysport will be great for you to continue from there on out in order to maintain your correction.  With the combination of HA and Botox/Dysport, a crease like yours can be almost 100% eliminated.</p><p> Please be sure to have someone who is skilled at HA injection to the glabella do the treatment.  Lack of knowledge of the vascular anatomy of that area can cause complication.  I would suggest a surgeon who does brow lifts since they have first hand knowledge of the anatomy. (Louis W. Apostolakis, MD, Austin Facial Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Botox is an excellent treatment for expression lines in the glabella – it works by reducing overactive muscle movement in the area to gradually soften the appearance of lines and wrinkles.
<p>The effects of Botox typically last 3-4 months, and most patient find that they need approximately 4 treatments per year to maintain their results. After years of repeated movement, sometimes deeper creases can form. While these will gradually improve with Botox injections, they will not fully resolve.</p><p>You may need some combination of Botox, dermal fillers (to help fill in the crease), and laser treatments (to stimulate new collagen growth) for best results. I would recommend scheduling a consultation with an experienced cosmetic dermatologist or plastic surgeon to discuss your treatment options. (Faiyaaz Kalimullah, MD, FAAD, Chicago Dermatologic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Botox is the best treatment for this area. If after several treatments with botox you do not have the results you desire, you may need to have the area treated with laser or dermal fillers. (Jean M. Casello, MD, Northborough Physician)
<p>The other FDA approved botulinum toxin products, Dysport and Xeomin, also are effective.  Go to a physician for these services with experience with the product.  Training in anatomy makes a difference.  Look for a Microdroplet Lift injector for this service to avoid the frozen forehead effect. (Kenneth D. Steinsapir, MD, Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox is a fabulous treatment for taking away that Angry Look</h4><p>Every day I treat patients with the same problem you are experiencing.  Botox (or other similar toxins), when used appropriately, can make you look more relaxed, less angry and more approachable. (Lorrie Klein, MD, Laguna Niguel Dermatologic Surgeon)<br>

</div><h5>Treatment of lines in glabella</h5><p>Botox usually can provide improvement to lines in the glabella for most people.  Since your line is fairly deep, it is possible that a filler could provide further improvement if needed. (Michael I. Echavez, MD, San Francisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The 11 lines that you are worried about can be softened with botox. Further softening is sometimes possible with off-label use of fillers in the area. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Deep 11’s – Treatment Options</h5><p>Medications like Botox and Xeomin can greatly help this area, but if you have deep lines etched in even when your face is fully relaxed, then you will likely need treatment beyond that.</p><p>Fillers in this area carry very significant risks including blindness and stroke. For that reason, I would seriously consider other safe options such as laser resurfacing and PDO threads. (Rebecca Gelber, MD, Incline Village Physician)<br>

</div>
<b>Don’t like my 11’s; Look unhappy even if I’m not: What can be done?</b><p>Wrinkle blocker will help reduce it.  Some folks get a tremendous improvement with Xeomin, Botox, Dysport alone.  Whereas others need filler though this is a higher danger zone area. Skin resurfacing can also be done.</p><p> Find any experienced injector. (John R. Burroughs, MD, Colorado Springs Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Treating the “angry look”</h4><p>Glabella lines are formed from frequent use of the underlying muscles. When the muscles are used, it causes a crease in the overlying skin, and over time, the crease can become permanently “etched” in the skin.</p><p>Regular Botox injections to the area relax the underlying muscles, which usually smoothes the overlying skin and reduces or relaxes wrinkles in the area. If the lines are still visible in the skin when you manually stretch your skin with your hands, then you may need additional correction in the area.<br>

</div>The collagen can be remodeled using laser devices such as CO2, fraxel, thermage, ultherapy, or microneedling. Small amounts of dermal filler can also be injected under the lines to help fill the crevices. I recommend you seek a consult with an experienced injector who can help you look as relaxed as you feel! (Supriya Tomar, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)
<h3>Botox for Deep glabellar lines</h3><p>Botox can certainly be used to help soften these lines but it will not erase them because they are too deep at rest. A filler can be added after the botox injections to give you an even better correction.</p><p>If you keep up with the botox every 4-5 months, you will keep the problem from getting worse so I think Botox could play a nice role in your cosmetic enhancement. (Robin Evans, MD, Stamford Dermatologist)<br>

</div>Botox injections are great at treating the glabella lines/wrinkles. The will definitely soften the area and prevent your lines from getting worse. I recommend seeing an expert in your area. I hope this help. (Alain Michon, MD, Ottawa Physician)
<p><strong>Botox for “upset” look</strong></p><p>“Upset” or “concerned” look with the frown lines can be treated with Botox. This is a very common treatment and generally takes few sessions to result in my smoother and relaxed appearance. Please make sure that you see an experienced doctor for a thorough consultation and assessment prior to undergoing any treatments. (Mariusz Sapijaszko, MD, FRCPC, Edmonton Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is the first step for treatment of frown lines. See how it goes.  Supplemental fillers can also help as can skin treatments such as certain lasers or microneedling. (Keith Denkler, MD, Marin Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>
<strong>Glabella lines</strong><p>You will likely need a combination of Botox and filler or a resurfacing laser. Botox will really help soften the lines but may not completely remove them so you may need a little bit of filler to top it off.</p><p>But be very careful about who you see for treatment. Filler in glabella can be very dangerous if done incorrectly. You want to make sure you follow with a highly trained provider such as a board certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon.</p><p>I would not recommend you see anyone else for such a delicate procedure. (Kenne Ogunmakin, MD, Katy Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>They can be softened without difficulty using Botox.  Please see a provider who injects frequently.  Botox cosmetic is safe and effective. (Robert Whitfield, MD, FACS, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Since your lines are deeper you will likely need a combination of treatments.  Use Botox first to see how much you can get the lines to soften.  After that you can use some filler to help soften the remainder.</p><p>  This is a temporary treatment lasting a few months, but one I think will work nicely for you. (Camille Cash, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Definitely meet with a provider who has a lot of experience with Botox. The glabella region, the area in between the eyebrows, is one of the most common areas we treat with Botox. You can expect to see a nice result with Botox. (Joshua Cooper, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Glabellar lines are formed due to hyperactivity of frown muscles over forehead. Initially they are visible in Dynamic phase when one is expressing. At that time these can be corrected by doing BOTOX of the overacting muscles! In due course of time these lines become permanent and even can be seen during static phase or without expressions! The static lines can be slightly improved by using BOTOX on the hyperactive muscles.</p><p>For further improvement one needs elevation of the depressed line/fold. That can be done by filling up either by Fillers or Fat grafting beneath the fixed line or fold! (Rajat Gupta, MD, MBBS, MS, DNB, India Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
