<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h5>n the hands of experienced aesthetic board-Botox is a cosmetic wonder drug</h5><p>Botox is generally used for lines around the eyes and forehead. However, in the proper hands, it can be used for wrinkles around the mouth as well. These areas a little more tricky so it important to go to an experienced injector.</p><p>In conjunction with fillers, the results can be great temporizing the need for surgery. (Pradeep K. Sinha, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox is wrinkle specific</b></p><p>Because Botox affects the nerves that signal muscle contraction, it is only useful for those types of lines and wrinkles.</p><p>Over the years doctors have found that Botox has many off-label uses and has some cosmetically beneficial effects on more dynamically caused wrinkles than originally intended.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2610" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

<li>Wrinkles and lines that are caused by loss of collagen or elastin are remedied by fillers.</li>
</ul><p>Many patients find the combination of both Botox and fillers extends the longevity of both. (Nissan Pilest, MD, Irvine Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox for dynamic wrinkes not passive wrinkles</i></p><p>Botox Cosmetic works by relaxing the dynamic muscles in the face and also the neck that cause those wrinkles to appear in the overlying skin. These areas include the glabella, forehead, crows feet, bunny lines (nose), lip lines, and frown lines that cause the corners of the mouth to turn dow, as well as certain chin wrinkles (orange peel).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2611" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In the neck Botox Cosmetic can be used for banding and platysma necklace lines. Botox does not help passive wrinkles caused by skin laxity and sun damage, and injections should only be performed by experienced and qualified professionals.</p><p>See the Physicians Coalition for Injectable Safety website for more details. (Harrison C. Putman III, MD, Peoria Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>BoTox has many uses</em></p><p>BoTox has had several novel uses pioneered by physicians across the country and indeed the world. It was originally approved for eyelid spasm and strabismus. It is currently used in cosmetic and reconstructive techniques–some of which may be “off-label.”</p><p>It can be used in the forehead, crow’s feet, the glabella, and even smokers’ lines and lip lines. It is also used to turn up the corner of the mouth (some patient’s request the Meg Ryan smile–think Meg in “When Harry Met Sally”–not the new&improved Meg). (Navin K.

</div><p><strong>Botox and facial wrinkles </strong></p><p>Botox is appropriate for wrinkles or line which form with facial motion. Botox relaxes the muscles which cause specific wrinkles. Frowning your eyebrow, wrinkling the forehead, or squinting the eyes are the best areas where Botox works best.</p><p>Botox does not replace basic skin care, injectable fillers, skin resurfacing, or cosmetic facial surgery. (Houtan Chaboki, MD, Washington DC Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox works for wrinkles caused by facial muscles</h3><p>Botox is a very effective treatment for certain wrinkles. As Botox works are relaxing muscle, it helps erase wrinkles that are caused by muscles. These wrinkles typically occur in the forehead, the area between the eyebrows, the Bunny line of the nose, and crows feet. (Pat Pazmino, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2613" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>Botox and Dysport, Versatility beyond wrinkles and lines</h3><p>Botox and Dysport are botulinum toxins that are FDA approved for cosmetic injection to minimize frown lines on forehead and crows feet.</p><p>In the hands of experienced aesthetic board-certified physician, Botox and Dysport can be used for several other so called off-labelled indications such as reduction of jaw muscles, lifting of eyebrows and corners of the mouth, excessive sweating on forehead and brows, migraine, etc. (William Ting, MD, Bay Area Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox Good for Different Areas</h4><p>Just to clarify, Botox® Cosmetic is used for the non-surgical treatment of facial aging, but Botox® (generically) has other uses, including the treatment of headaches, excessive sweating and limb spasticity. Botox® Cosmetic is FDA-approved for the treatment of the frown lines in the glabella area which is the area between the eyebrows.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2614" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-9fadb3622900feb413ea2b631cba6768">

</div><p>However, most physicians inject Botox® Cosmetic into other areas where there are wrinkles or frown lines secondary to dynamic muscles. These other areas include the “crows feet” (smile lines on the sides of the eyes), forehead, neck, and also in the areas around the mouth. (Channing R. Barnett, MD, Boca Raton Dermatologist)</p><h3>Botox is a good facial wrinkle treatment</h3><p>Botox “cosmetic” is FDA approved only for treatment of the frown lines between the eyebrows, but most physicians utilize Botox also in the “crows feet” areas as well as in the forehead and sometimes in the area around the mouth.</p><p>Botox “cosmetic” is a very important tool for the non-surgical treatment of facial aging, but Botox generically also has many other uses, including treatment of headaches and excessive sweating.

Levens, MD, Coral Springs Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2615" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p><i>Botox is great for “frown lines” and other areas.</i></p><p>Although Botox and Dysport are probably best known for their ability to minimize the appearance of fine lines around the eyes and on the forehead, they also work well to minimize lines in other areas such as those around the mouth.</p><p>They are remarkable treatments because they can achieve substantial results with virtually no down time. The injections take only a few minutes to perform, and patients can return to work or other activities immediately afterward.</p><p>it is not uncommon for patients to get Botox or Dysport injections during their lunch hour!</p><p>Unlike the effects of fillers which are immediate, it takes anywhere from one to two weeks for the effect to be apparent, and the effects usually persist for 3-4 months.</p><p>In addition to making the face appear more youthful, the majority of patients find that the effect also makes them look less tired, and less stern. (Lisa Ishii, MD, Baltimore Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox® good for “dynamic” lines</h4><p>Botox® is good for dynamic lines, that is lines which are formed by muscle movement. Lines that are there even when you don’t move your muscles generally won’t be improved with Botox®. (Mario Loomis, MD, Middletown Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox is used for wrinkles caused by muscle movement…</em></p><p>Botox is used for wrinkles caused by muscle movement mostly around the eye areas that include the crowsfeet, forehead, and between the eyes called the glabella. It is not used in the folds between nose and the corner of the mouth.</p><p>Be sure to discuss your questions with a qualified doctor before having the procedure done. (Andrew Miller, MD, Edison Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is a muscle paralyzer. Therefore, it will only work on lines that originate from overacting muscles. It works by paralyzing those overactive muscles. The frown lines and the forehead lines are ideal lines to be treated because they are caused from overactive frown and forehead muscles.</p><p>Relaxing those muscles softens the lines. The crows feet are often helped by Botox as well, but less predictably then the forehead and frown lines. Other lines may be helped but you need to see a qualified Botox injector for proper guidance. (Sam Goldberger, MD, Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox softens wrinkles anywhere on the face- almost</h4><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2616" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Botox is a wonderful treatment for wrinkles caused by the muscles of facial expression. Frown lines, crows feet, forehead lines, some lip lines, down turning corner of the mouth, and bunny lines. It is not a great treatment for the deeper folds separating the cheek and mouth. Fillers do better there. (Brian Maloney, MD, FACS, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox Dilemma</strong></p><p>Botox could treat nearly every wrinkle on your face. The reason is that Botox stops muscles from moving and muscles cause most wrinkles on your face. The dilemma is that you can’t stop all of the muscles on your face from moving because it would make your face unable to perform its jobs (eat/talk/blink) and furthermore you would lose important good expressions like smiling.</p><p>So, Botox is very useful on selected muscles such as between your eyebrows, forehead, crow’s feet, side of nose, and chin as the movement in these areas can be suppressed without affecting you in a negative way functionally or aesthetically.
