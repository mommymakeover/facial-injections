Never receive Botox or any other medical treatment in an environment where alcohol is being served.</p><p>You must be clear-headed and able to understand the procedure and give informed consent to the treatment.</p><p>You should also be making the decisions that you want — not what your friends want you to have.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3502" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-2e919f2fd429e57e6b696af7dc1bd7e4">

</div><p>You may have bleeding or bruising that is best managed in a prepared office setting.</p><p>You may have an emotional reaction to the needle and feel light-headed, and a medical office is well prepared to deal with that.</p><p>And while it may be rare to get a side effect from Botox, do you really want that one person to be you? Do you really want to wait weeks or months for the effects of Botox to wear off? Don’t look for a deal or for a good time when it comes to your medical treatments and your health. (Jordana S. Gilman, MD, Washington Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>BOTOX is typically injected at a medical clinic, usually by a dermatologist or plastic surgeon.</p><p>While a physician can come to your home and inject lots of people with BOTOX at a party, it is not generally advised since it is not always the cleanest place, and sometimes a person can feel faint (“vasovagal”) or there may be slight bleeding for which it is good to be in a medical clinic setting.

</div><p><b>Party line on Botox parties: Don’t do it</b></p><p>Botox has become so commonplace, and has such an excellent safety record that it is tempting to forget that it is a prescription medical prodect that should be administered in an appropriate medical context.</p><p>There are issues of informed consent, especially in a party environment, good lighting for the injector, and the needles once they are used are hazardous medical waste that needs to be handled properly.</p><p>I think most experienced injectors will not see the need for the type of promotion that Botox parties represent. (Richard Baxter, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Are Botox Parties Safe?</h3><p>Administration of Botox is a medical procedure, requiring some skill and training. I am concerned by the phrasing of your question that you do not realize that this procedure, like any other does have risks associated with it, including the risk of asymmetry (the face is uneven), eyelid drooping, and others.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3504" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Before performing any procedure on a patient, responsible surgeons would want to know they had educated the patient fully about the procedure, its recovery, and its risks as well as alternatives, and that the patient was electing to proceed without any coercion or self-consciousness about changing her mind and saying no.</p><p>A party setting raises many concerns- is alcohol being served? If so, informed consent is immediately suspect. Even if no alcohol is being served, it is much more difficult to say no if you are sitting around with a bunch of your friends and they are all having something done.</p><p>Peer pressure exists at all ages. Who is hosting the party, and where? It’s possible that if a friend of yours has Botox and experiences a complication, they may argue they didn’t want it in the first place, but had it under pressure from the guests and the doctor- and now they want to hold you as the host, the owner of the home or restaurant where the party occurred, and the doctor responsible for her poor outcome.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3505" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>A lawyers dream. I would also frankly be concerned that any physician who agrees to participate in such a party is probably not the ethical and responsible physician you deserve- I can tell you for sure they are not a member of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery or The American Board of Plastic Surgery- as both have rules against participation in these types of gatherings.</p><p>So be careful, and realize that while it may sound like fun during the party, the risks are significant- and while it does “wear off”, it would be months before it did so. (Armando Soto, MD, FACS, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox parties</b></p><p>Administering Botox is a medical procedure. It really should not be done at Botox parties where alcohol is served and people are not completely sober to understand and agree to the risks of the procedure.

</div><p><b>Botox is great to look good FOR a party, but don’t do it AT a party</b></p><p>Doctors, nurses and/or dentists who perform medical treatments such as Botox or Juvederm injections at parties where alcohol is being served or in environments such as homes or hair salons that do not have the proper lighting and cleanliness are risking your health and safety.</p><p>Don’t let a cheap price or a friend who is probably getting a great deal on her treatments if she gets you to come to her house or salon convince you. Use common sense. (Lorrie Klein, MD, Laguna Niguel Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox is not for parties</h5><p>A social situation is not a place for a medical treatment like Botox: A skilled experienced licensed medical professional is necessary to perform the treatment in the safest way and with the best results; such a person is not going to be at a Botox party.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3507" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Social pressures or alcohol shouldn’t be allowed to influence a person’s decision. Risk of infection or improper used needle disposal is greater in a social setting. What if the patient or their friend faints or something else bad happens?. (Margaret Weiss, MD, Baltimore Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>It depends on what you mean by a Botox Party</h5><p>If you mean a social situation where alcohol is being served, than that is absolutely the wrong place for any medical treatment to be provided. If you mean a group consultation in a medical office, with a well trained provider of the service, than there may be a place for such a party. (Michael H. Rosenberg, MD, Mount Kisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Parties are great but save them for birthdays</em></p><p>Botox is a prescription drug that should be administerred in a medical setting. You want the treatment tailored to your needs by an experienced injector. Botox parties will increase your risk of infection, poor result, and potential disaster as you might not actually be getting Botox. (Jerome Potozkin, MD, Danville Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3508" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h4>Be Wary of Botox Parties</h4><p>Medical procedures should always be performed in a medical facility. There are too many variables involved that can lead to a major diasater, e.g. counterfeit non-FDA approved botulinum toxin, unlicensed injector, injections given and/or received under influence of alcohol, contaminated needles potentially exposing unawared to HIV or hepatitis C.</p><p>Your health is worth more than few bucks you may save at a Botox party. (William Ting, MD, Bay Area Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Risk of Botox Parties</em></p><p>While there may not be huge risks in attending a “Botox Party”, most self respecting practitioners would never participate in one. So, if the quality and credibility of your physician (or nurse) injector is important to you then you will probably want to skip these parties and find a practitioner that provides Botox in a more professional setting. (Harold J. Kaplan, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox Party in Los Angeles</strong></p><p>Botox injections are a medical procedure and should be performed in a medical setting under physician supervision. Botox parties are not advised and proper informed consent, sterile technique, and postprocedural care is essential. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
