(David L.

</div><p><em>Getting rid of the “angry look” on your face</em></p><p>Botox is used to treat the “angry lines” or “frown lines” or “11s” between the eyebrows. Although Botox treatments are generally repeated every 3-4 months, the injections are rapid with no downtime after, generally little or no discomfort, and low risk of complications. (William Andrade, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox for angry look is a start</i></p><p>Botox is one of the most commonly performed non-surgical cosmetic surgery procedures.</p><p>These ‘lunch time lifts’ are very effective and economical alternatives to a more permanent solution to the ‘angry look’ problem.</p><p>Patients who are in the same position that you are in often realize that they like the results from the Botox treatments but they do not like the fact that they must re-treat every 4 month to 6 months.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2680" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>In those cases, we recommend that a patient consider an endoscopic brow lift.

These physical changes tend to make patients look tired and angry which can be a social disability.</p><p>For these reasons, it’s not unusual for patients to seek correction of this problem. Several options are currently available for treating this type of problem.</p><p>These include botox which weakens the corrugator muscles, division of the corrugator muscles, dermal fillers which fill in the vertical frown lines and when brow descent is present brow lift procedures as well.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2681" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In someone who has vertical glabellar frown lines who wants a more permanent solution and is adverse to repetitive injections of dermal fillers and botox, surgery may be the best option, especially if brow descent is present as well.</p><p>Under these circumstances, an endoscopic brow lift might be an excellent alternative. If you’re considering endoscopic brow lift, consultation with a board-certified plastic surgeon is appropriate. This surgeon should be able to formulate a treatment plan that’s appropriate for you. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>4 options to get rid of the “angry look”</h4><p>The angry look is usually caused by overactive corrugator muscles (the frown muscles). This can be reduced or eliminated by four different means:</p><p>1) Botox. This is the simplest and least expensive method, but also typically lasts the shortest amount of time (3-4 months). Botox works by paralyzing the corrugator muscles so that you can no longer frown. With time the wrinkle just goes away.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2682" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>2) Fat injections/fillers. Fat injections, Juvederm or Radiesse can all be used to fill in the crease(s) formed by the frown muscles. Fat has the added advantage that when it takes it will last for years.</p><p>3) Division/removal of the corrugators. This is a much more permanent solution since the muscles can be permanently removed either through a forehead incision or eyelid incision.</p><p>4) Brow-lift. This is similar to a corrugator division but has the added advantage of repositioning the brow into a more rested/ natural position. (Robert M. Jensen, MD, Medford Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox the best for angry look</h5><p>Botox (or Dysport) would be correcting the only FDA approved indication in your case. Many of our patients ( I do not allow our aesthetician to inject) tell us that their friends think they are in a good mood or have returned from vacation.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2683" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>I would recommend that you try Botox injections once, and then decide whether it is worth maintaining. Most of us have also noted that after three or four times, you can space your Botox sessions further apart.</p><p>Some of us also are seeing longer results with Dysport (lasting 4-5 months) so you might look into that alternative. (Arnold R. Oppenheim, MD, Virginia Beach Dermatologist)</p><h5>How to get rid of the “Angry Look”</h5><p>For wrinkles between the brows, Botox is an excellent option. Some patients simply do not want to have injections performed every 3-4 months, which is understandable. The one thing to remember is that nothing really works better for wrinkling between the brows than neuromodulator medications like Botox, Dysport, or Xeomin.</p><p>The procedure can be performed quickly and easily in the office within just a few minutes, and patients can then go about their day. For those who are strongly opposed to these injections, other options do exist, including laser skin resurfacing, chemical peels, dermabrasion, microneedling, topical skin care, fillers, and brow lifting techniques that directly weaken the muscles in this area.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2684" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>All of these options can help, but in most cases, tend to have higher risks and less chance of success than Botox. A consultation with a facial plastic surgeon or plastic surgeon can be helpful to review all of the options in detail. (Matthew Richardson, MD, Frisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox and brow furrows</i></p><p>You may be happy to know that Botox was approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration to treat the muscles that are causing the furrows between your eyebrows. And since each person is unique, you may only need a Botox treatment every 4 or 5 months to soften those lines and prevent others from mistaking you as “looking angry.”. (Virginia A. Pittman-Waller, MD, Webster Physician)</p><p><strong>Angry look</strong></p><p>Botox is very effective at softening the lines between the eyes and on the forehead. However, descent of the brow between the eyes may also deepen furrows in this location and cause an “angry look”.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2685" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

(Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Frown Lines Reduced with Botox</h4><p>I assume the area of concern which you are speaking is the frown region of the face. This is brought about by over activity of the frown muscles. Hooding from excess eyelid of the upper eyelid and a lower brow position can contribute to this “angry look’.</p><p>Frowning occurs from a normal facial expression. Squinting from direct sunlight and eye straining to read adds to the appearance. The quickest and very efficient way is to address the problem with Botox or other neuromodulators such as Xeomin or Dysport.</p><p>There are surgical procedures such as the endoscopic corrugator resection. Dermal or fat grafting in the frown region is an adjunct once the excess motor activity has been addressed. (Robert W. Sheffield, MD, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Angry to happy</h3><p>Another area to pay attention to is the brow position. Brow position can have a profound effect on how people perceive ones mood.</p><p>That is something to keep in mind. I think there is no doubt you would benefit from botox. If you wanted a more permanent treatment we can reduce the muscle that causes the issue (corrugators and/or the procerus muscle).</p><p>We do that often during a brow lift. Another option, which I am a big fan of, is fat transfer. We can fill those furrows as well as lift the lateral peak of the brow.</p><p>Something to research a bit at the least.
