<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h4>Too much Botox may drop the eyebrows and cause the upper eyelids to look heavy</h4><p>Botox use in the forehead should be subtle. We prefer a relaxed, not frozen appearance. While the right number of units will vary depending how many horizontal lines a patient is seeking to treat, we find many patients fall into the 8-15 unit range for the forehead alone. A small amount goes a long way here. (Anand D. Patel, MD, Brookfield Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox and heavy brows</b></p><p>Too much botox can definitely over weaken the brow elevator muscles and hence cause the brows to be too heavy and worsen the upper lid laxity. Some of this can be countered by weakening the brow depressor muscles.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2917" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Or you can weight until the Botox wears off as this will also undo the brow heaviness. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Use Botox Sparingly with a Tall Forehead or Heavy Eyelids</h4><p>I have been using Botox since the 1990’s when everyone wanted a “frozen forehead’-without a line or crease.</p><p>But the trend quickly shifted to a softer, non- paralyzed look in the forehead. If you have a tall forehead or already have heaviness in the upper eyleids, I recommend treating the frown lines and crow’s feet before the forehead, to minimize the brow droop. (Edward Szachowicz, MD, PhD, Minneapolis Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox problems</em></p><p>When the eyes feel a bit low, then more than likely the botox was injected a bit low and the frontalis muscle can not elevate the brow.

</div><h3>Oops, bad Botox</h3><p>What happens as you age is that you rely more on the forehead muscles (frontalis muscle) to hold your eyebrows up. If you inject these muscles with Botox then you relax them and your brows will of course drop down making them look heavy and saggy.</p><p>It also makes it hard to put on your eye make-up since your brows and lids are drooping down. So really as you age you need LESS botox not more and you probably need to avoid injecting the forehead all together if you have it done again. It will wear off but slowly. (Patricia Farris, MD, Metairie Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox may contribute to the low lying appearance of your lids if it is not artfully placed to balance the muscles while allowing you to have motion in the forehead.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2919" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The Botox effects will wear off. Once this occurs you may evaluate your lids to see if a blepharoplasty is desirable to improve the lid appearance. (Jeffrey S. Rosenthal, MD, Fairfield Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox can cause the forehead to “drop” </b></p><p>Because the frontalis muscle is a brow elevating muscle, injection of Botox into this muscle may cause some depression or “dropping” of the brow. In many cases this may be someone exaggerated during the first few weeks after the injection and usually subsides to some degree.</p><p>It is important to note that brow drooping is much different from eyelid drooping that sometimes occurs as a complication of Botox injection and the two issues are treated differently. (Brian Harmych, MD, Cleveland Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is very important that a proper analysis of the muscle around the eyes be performed as to avoid excessive treatment of the forehead muscles which are critical in preventing the eyes from dropping too low.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2920" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-e24e597143b25244ff1b1a78a26ec2eb">

</div><p>In my practice, it would be unusual to treat a woman’s forehead with too much botulinum protein as you want to maintain an aesthetically arched eyebrow. What you are describing is a droopy eyebrow as a result of the injection.</p><p>Unfortunately there is no specific treatment besides to wait for the botox to wear off. (Teanoosh Zadeh, MD, FRCSC, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox Drooping</strong></p><p>First off, know that the drooping you’re experiencing will go away with time. It could be as quickly as a couple weeks. This bagging is temporary and is an indication that there was a little too much relaxation of the brow muscle above that eyelid.</p><p>Be sure to make your physician aware of what happened so that they can take careful measures to ensure that this doesn’t occur again in the future. (Jeffrey W. Hall, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2921" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><b>Caution with Botox treatment</b></p><p>As we age the forehead tends to settle a bit, and we keep the brows up by by having our forehead muscle slightly contracted. If too much Botox is injected than the muscles is no longer able to keep the brows up and we get the droop.</p><p>The other way, is if Botox migrates to the levator muscle, and the patient can get a true eyelid droop.</p><p>Good news is that as Botox wear out so will the droop. Even though it appears that injecting Botox is quite easy, and a number of doctors do this procedure, it takes experience, knowledge of facial anatomy and good judgment to successfully treat patients with Botox.

Reg. $13.00 per unit. (Vincent N.

(Mahsa Sohrab, MD, New Haven Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox and Brow Droop</i></p><p>Botox injected into the muscles that hold the brow at its position above the eye can paralyze these muscles and cause brow droop, or ptosis. Botox injected into adjacent areas can also diffuse and cause the same problem.</p><p>It’s not an issue of the amount of drug delivered, it’s an issue with the location of the injection. It should resolve once the Botox wears off, but if you’d like a quicker fix it may be possible to inject the antagonist muscles to bring the brow back to an appropriate position. (Samuel Lien, MD, Everett Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox causes droopy eyebrows?</i></p><p>Neurotoxin injections often do result in an eyebrow droop. That being said, injection should only be given by a certified injector. Thorough examination of muscular contracture should be done before any such injection. (Christopher J.

</div><h4>Eyebrows Drop After Botox</h4><p>The muscle that causes the wrinkles in the forehead is also the muscle that helps maintain the brows in their position above the superior orbital rim along with other soft tissue attachments.</p><p>When Botox is used to treat this wrinkles, the frontalis muscle weakens which helps reduce wrinkles, but in someone with loss of eyebrow support, it may also drop the brows a bit. There are ways to inject the Botox in order to cause the opposite effect and LIFT your BROWS! Now, this must be performed by an experienced injector that knows the anatomy well in order to treat those muscles that tend to pull down the brows (eyebrow depressors).

</div><p>The drooping of the brow is a result of the technique or where the Botox was injected. It will wear off typically before the smoothing effects on the wrinkles wears off. Well trained Registered Nurses with an appropriate state nursing license, under the direct supervision of a Medical Doctor, who is at the location during the injection, can safely and effectively inject Botox.</p><p>The nurse should have extensive experience in the treatment, and should have been trained by the Medical Doctor. Spas and Botox treatment centers without adequate supervision can be dangerous. According to state medical licensing requirements, the doctor needs to be on site and immediately available.</p><p>It is appropriate to ask the person who is going to do the injections about their education, training, experience, licensing, and supervision.</p><p>A weekend course, inadequate experience, inadequate supervision, or a lack of credentials can be dangerous.</p><p>If something doesn’t add up, go somewhere else! (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Eyebrows dropping</b></p><p>Eyebrows can drop with improper Botox technique. For that reason you should utilize only an expert and experienced physician injector. (Kris M. Reddy, MD, FACS, West Palm Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Can Too Much Botox Cause Eyebrows to Drop?</em></p><p>It may not be a droopy eye lid, it seems that you need an endoscopic eyebrow lift. An endoscopic lift involves the use of smaller incisions and a miniature camera, which is inserted into one of the incisions to allow the doctor to see what is happening while the necessary adjustments are made. (Jhonny Salomon, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox Dosing for the Forehead Requires Care</h3><p>The frontalis muscle, which is responsible (in part) for those lateral lines in the forehead skin, varies significantly in strength between patients. Some will require only 3 or 4 units laterally, and giving 5 or 6 may drop the eyebrow.</p><p>The key to satisfactory Botox treatment is a consistent and open relationship with your provider. This way, your specific facial anatomy is noted and the effects of the treatment are recorded over time. (Evan Ransom, MD, FACS, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox and saggy eyes</h3><p>Too much Botox or Botox placed too low in the forehead can lead to saggy or droopy eyes. It is really important to go to an experienced Botox injector for this cosmetic procedure who understands the facial anatomy.</p><p>The good news is that Botox wears off and it will go back to normal when it is gone in several months. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h4>Too Much Botox</h4><p>If the procedure is not done correctly, yes this can cause your eyes to droop. This is why it is important to do your research on the Physician of choice. Go in for an initial consultation ask as many questions that you feel is necessary that will satisfy your concerns.</p><p>If you are not happy with the answers continue to look for a Reputable/Knowledgeable Physician and insure you are comfortable with the answers they give.
