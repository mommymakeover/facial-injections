<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Botox is only temporary. It will last about 3-4 months. Wrinkles will return to their original state when it wears off.</p><p>It can be stopped at any time. Botox is the most popular cosmetic procedure worldwide with millions of treatments performed each year. It is extremely safe. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is a purified protein used to address wrinkles associated with facial expression. A very common misconception is that if one gets Botox one must continue it indefinitely. The results of a Botox treatment are not permanent.</p><p>Most people enjoy their results for 3-4 months. At that point a maintenance treatment is recommended to protect one’s investment. If the effects are not desired, the treatment can either be adjusted or not performed again.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4886" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>After 3-4 months, the wrinkles return to what they looked like before. However if a person does regular treatments for several years and then stops, the wrinkles will likely be better than they were before.</p><p>Please consult with a doctor for specific recommendations. (Alex Eshaghian, MD, PhD, Encino Physician)</p><p>Botox is not permanent, is a temporary treatment. It can last anywhere from 3-4 months, sometimes longer depending on the patient. It works to prevent wrinkles from getting worse, if you stop treatments the aging process continues as it would normally.</p><p>You can stop treatments at any time. (Francis Johns, MD, Greensburg Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is a temporary muscle relaxant. It is not permanent. The duration of Botox varies from person to person, and the area of injection. The muscle relaxation induced by Botox will gradually decreases over 3-4 months.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4887" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Using Botox at an early age can prevent one from getting permanent lines. The lines do not get worse if you stop using it. (Shanthala Shivananjappa, MD, Boston Physician)</p><h3>BOTOX® Cosmetic is not permanent</h3><p>BOTOX works by temporarily relaxing the muscles that are causing the wrinkles in a specific area such as the outer eyes, the forehead, and the area between your eyebrows.</p><p>The effect typically wears off within 3-4 months for first time patients. If you have one treatment and then decide to stop after that, your wrinkles will not get worse, they will just return to what they were prior to your first BOTOX treatment.</p><p>However, over time, the dynamic wrinkles (lines from expression – frowning – squinting – raising your forehead) will become more and more visible without the treatment. The reason patients continue with treatment is because they appreciate having smoother, softer and wrinkle free skin and not because their wrinkles will get worse.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4888" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Should you decided to take the first step (a consultation) I would recommend researching a physician who has a great reputation and has a lot of experience with injections as the result is dependant on the injection technique and the amount of BOTOX injected. (Manish Khanna, MD, FRCP(C), Montreal Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox effects are not permanent – they typically last 3-4 months. That is why people who like the results return for repeat injections to maintain the muscle relaxation and softening of lines and wrinkles that Botox achieves.</p><p>Maintaining Botox also helps prevent progression or deepening of the wrinkles that would occur without it. If you stop getting Botox, the wrinkles return but they are not worse than they would have been without the Botox. (Roby F. Hayes, MD, Portland Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4889" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><i>Botox is not permanent.</i></p><p>The direct effects wear off at 3-4 months but there is some clinical retraining of muscles and these effects can persist up to 6 months. Then the treatment wears off, we are 6 months older so the lines do come back but no they are not really worse.</p><p>This is a well established and highly effective service. (Kenneth D. Steinsapir, MD, Beverly Hills Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Absolutely not!</strong></p><p>Botox generally lasts for 4 months in most people so you should schedule it 3 times a year. If you choose to stop using it, then you will just return to how you looked before hand. However, if you have been using it for many years, and then stop, you will effectively have fewer wrinkles than if you had never used Botox because your treatments would have prevented wrinkles from forming over several years.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4890" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Does that make sense? I tend to see my patients 3 times a year for natural looking results. (Ravi Jain, MBBS, London Physician)</p><h4>Is Botox permanent? Is there a penalty if I stop using BoTox?</h4><p>As all have responded, all neurotoxins including BoTox are not permanent. For sure you can stop using BoTox at any time. The use of BoTox and other neurotoxins has not accelerated the aging process as published in a peer reviewed journal. (Michael Kulick, MD, DDS, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is definitely not permanent, and stopping it will in no way make you look worse than you started. In order to maintain the improved appearance, you do need to continue to get Botox every 3-6 months, but stopping it won’t hurt anything. (Andrew Campbell, MD, Milwaukee Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4891" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c7b3e0b9854ed013c1592278f6f706f4">

</div><p>You can always stop Botox without having bad or worse results. Botox weakens the muscle temporarily. With your first treatment, it usually lasts around 3 months. As your muscles become more weakened with repeat Botox use, the effect can actually last several weeks longer.</p><p>If you stop using Botox completely, your muscles will eventually restore themselves to their original strength and activity and your normal wrinkles will return. Your muscles will not become hyperactive so you do not have to worry about even greater wrinkles than before.</p><p>Some people feel like their wrinkles appear worse after stopping Botox because they have become so used to looking wrinkle free and forget that the normal aging process will make wrinkles look worse even with time. (Johnson C. Lee, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is a very safe and effective treatment to soften wrinkles leaving you with a refreshed look. Botox normally lasts 3-4 months. The wrinkle do not get worse after you stop Botox and one can stop Botox at any time. (Praven Chetty, MD, Kelowna Physician)</p><h3>Botox is not permanent</h3><p>The effect on muscle movement lasts 3-4 months, the clinical effect on the wrinkle appearance may last a few months longer. The long term effect of consistent Botox treatments is like rewinding the clock a few years then essentially stopping it for as long as the treatments are continued.</p><p>Once you stop, the clock will restart. If you had a twin and we treated you and not your twin for say 20 years, you will look at least 20 yrs younger in the treatment area even if you stop the treatments.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_4893" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>At some point, if you don’t care anymore about your appearance, by all means stop. You will still look better than your contemporaries. (Peter T. Truong, MD, Fresno Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Is Botox permanent</b></p><p>Botox or any other cosmetic neurotoxin is meant to relax the muscles that it is injected in to. Therefore once the injected Botox is cleared from your body, there is no more relaxing effect left, and hence you expression lines will return.</p><p>That means Botox is not permanent; so is the effect of exercise. Once you stop exercising you will return to your former-self. In other words one will not become worse after stopping Botox, just the same way one will not become worse than they were once they stopped exercising.</p><p>Due to the nice results experienced, one would like to continue the treatments, but they don’t have to. (Ram Chandra, MD, Edison Physician)</p><p><em>Botox myths</em></p><p>Botox is not permanent. It will reduce wrinkling after treatment and prevent them from getting worse if used long term. Once stopped it will not make you age any quicker or look any worse if not used in the first place.</p><p>Again, it should actually reduce the severity of the wrinkles in the long term. (Raymond E. Lee, MD, Orange County Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox – Temporary</b></p><p>Botox is not permanent, it is temporary and is injected into the muscles in order to paralyze and prevent movement in that injection site. Botox lasts anywhere from 3-6 months depending upon the patient. You can stop using Botox at any time, please consult with a board certified plastic surgeon.(Randal Haworth, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox typically needs to be repeated every 3-4 months. Your wrinkles will return after it wears off. Botox can prevent worsening of your wrinkles however. (Kristin J. Tarbet, MD, FACS, Bellevue Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>Botox isn’t permanent and usually lasts 3-6 months. Botox can actually prevent wrinkles from getting worse. I recommend getting a formal evaluation with a cosmetic dermatologist. (Jason Emer, MD, Los Angeles Dermatologic Surgeon)
<p>Botox is not permanent and lasts 3-6 months, with an average duration of 4 months. </p><p>If you are pleased with your result, then you can continue to receive Botox. Should you decide not to continue regular Botox treatments, the creases will likely return, but you will be no worse off having received Botox.</p><p>Please keep in mind that etched creases may require multiple Botox treatments in order to see the best results. Beautiful and natural results can be achieved. Please be sure to see an expert injector for an in-person consultation to fully discuss your goals and expectations in order to determine the best treatment plan.(Christian N. Ford, M.D., Boston Physician)</p></div>
