<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><em>Alternatives to Botox</em></p><p>If you mean you’d like an alternative to an injectable neurotoxin, then the answer is No.</p><p>The creams really don’t work very well–studies have shown they have about 30% of the efficacy of the injectable.</p><p>There are other brands of injectable toxins such as Dysport and Puretox but they need to be injected with a needle just like Botox and work and cost similarly so don’t see that there’s any real difference. (M. Christine Lee, MD, Walnut Creek Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Alternatives to Botox Montreal</strong></p><p>The best treatment for what are called “active” forehead lines, i.e. lines that are mainly present when actively raising the eyebrows, are the neurotoxins. These are substances which block the muscles that cause these lines.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2438" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The best known of these neurotoxins is Botox. In my clinic in Montreal Botox is the only neurotoxin I use as it is the only one approved for cosmetic uses in Canada. Dysport, another neurotoxin, is not yet available and Xeomin, the neurotoxin that most resembles Botox, is only approved for non-cosmetic uses thus far, although many doctors do use Xeomin in an off-label manner for facial wrinkles. (Arie Benchetrit, MD, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Unfortunately, Botox or an equivelent is the best answer for forehead wrinkles</b></p><p>Even a forehead lift usually does not do a lot long term for forehead wrinkles. The lift is good at elevating the brows, but does not do well for the lines. I would continue or start Botox ( or equivelent ) if you are looking for improvement. (Nathan Mayl, MD (retired), Fort Lauderdale Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2439" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h4>Alternatives to Botox?</h4><p>Are there alternatives to Botox? To answer this question in a word, “NO!” Botox, which is a particular brand of botulinim toxin (the other brand is Dysport), has no equivalent. No creams or other special cures will replicate the action of botulinum, which works by decreasing the contraction of the muscles that cause wrinkles.</p><p>Peels (both laser and chemical) and surgery are effective at treating some of the aging changes, but I would assume that if you are reticent to proceed with injections, you are also likely to not be very interested in surgery.</p><p>Bang for the buck, I say that botulinum injections are the best initial cosmetic procedure in terms of cost, benefit, and risk. (P. Daniel Ward, MD, Salt Lake City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2440" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The other main FDA-approved competitor to Botox Cosmetic is Dysport. Both work well for “dynamic” wrinkles- those caused by expression, especially in the forehead, “crow’s feet” and glabella. Their safety profiles are excellent, with few side effects for most people. (Thomas Fiala, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Are there Botox alternatives?</b></p><p>The only available alternatives to Botox that help with wrinkles as well as Botox does are other botulinum toxins, Dysport and Xeomin. There are a number of over the counter cosmetic preparations that claim they are as good as Botox at reducing wrinkles.</p><p>Those claims are not true. At the present there is no preparation on the market that can be used on the surface of the skin that will interrupt the signal that nerves send to muscles to contract, which is how Botox and other botulinum toxins work. (Emily Altman, MD, Short Hills Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2441" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-f05e44f2688612a1ffc8d39d5944c6a0">

</div><p><strong>Best Botox Alternatives</strong></p><p>The best alternative to Botox on the market currently is Dysport which is made by Medicis and works faster. Another competitor is called Xeomin made by Merz Pharmaceuticals which owns Radiesse and is close to FDA approval.</p><p>Their is also a form of topical Botox which is undergoing FDA trials and is owned by Revance Pharmaceuticals. (Grace Liu, MD, Newport Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Dysport Works Like Botox</i></p><p>Dysport was FDA approved in the first part of 2010. Dysport is botulinum toxin type A, the same as Botox. There are some differences in the exact protein complex but for the most part, the two products are interchangable.</p><p>Dysport does take affect quicker (usually within 24 hours instead of 3 days). Both products are similar in duration of affect. Dysport is a little less expensive than Botox. Dysport is measured differently than Botox so you can not compare “unit” price.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2442" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You need to compare cost of effective treatment which should be a little lower for Dysport. (Louis W. Apostolakis, MD, Austin Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Dysport and Xeomin are coming!</b></p><p>The alternative to Botox is Dysport. This is a sill pretty new product directly competing with Botox. Many plastic surgeons were very excited about this addition of new product on the market. For years Botox was the only choice for temporary active wrinkle reduction.</p><p>Healthy competition is always a good thing! However it is important to remember Botox has over 10 years of experience behind it and has proven to be very safe and effective over the years. There is also a new product -Xeomin, which debut is also coming soon.</p><p>The experienced plastic surgeon will definitely suggest the right product for you and the one he is comfortable with. (Gregory Turowski, MD, PhD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2443" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><i>Dysport is the alternative to Botox in US</i></p><p>Dysport was recently FDA approved for use in the US. It works similarly to Botox. It is being marketed aggressively and is priced slightly cheaper than Botox. My anecdotal experience is that Dysport “diffuses” more in the forehead weakening a wider area of the forehead muscle than Botox.</p><p>Because of this I use Botox in the forehead but find that both are effective for all other areas of the face. (Stephen Weber, MD, FACS, Denver Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox alternatives</h5><p>Here in the United States, the only other FDA approved botox alternative is Dysport, which works with a similar mechanism. Expect other botox like agents to be made available soon. (Anil R. Shah, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2444" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h5>Dysport for now but soon another alternative</h5><p>Dysport is the only other neurotoxin other than Botox that has been FDA approved, but you can expect a product called Xeomin to be out fairly soon. Dysport has the same contraindications as Botox and in addition, an allergy to cow’s milk protein is also included. (Harrison C. Putman III, MD, Peoria Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Wrinkles on forehead</b></p><p>if you do not want botox to treat the forehead, then realise you are eliminating the number one choice for this treatment as nothing works as well except for a surgical brow lift, which may leave you permanently numb in the forward part of the scalp, unless an endoscopic browlift is done.</p><p>The surgical lift is not permanent and has some risk that Botox does not but if you are very happy with the result, then you don’t have to continue to have botox injected every four to five months.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2445" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Fillers can work, but are not easy to do in the lines of the forehead and could cause lumps. (Ronald Shelton, MD, Manhattan Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox Alternatives</em></p><p>Dysport is the only available FDA approved alternative to Botox currently available. Dysport is used in a very similar fashion as Botox to treat unwanted lines and creases in the forehead and around the eyes. (John M. Hilinski, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The only comparable Botox alternative is Dysport. Dysport is also a Botulinum type A. I do not believe that there are any other alternative with equal effect. (Carlos Wolf, MD, Miami Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Limited alternatives to Botox</em></p><p>Since Dysport has the same active molecule as Botox, that isn’t really an alternative in the sense that you are asking. But nothing else really works the way these products do, providing a quick, reliable, and safe treatment for wrinkles caused by hyperactive muscles of expression.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2446" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-c5a320fa69312d561fc6cd54de925dff">

</div><p>For the muscle that causes the vertical lines between the eyebrows, there is the option of surgical removal with a browlift but that is only something to consider if you need a browlift too. Since you have forehead wrinkles, that may be worth looking into since they might be caused by compensating for a drooping brow (or sometimes just the upper eyelids.)</p><p>Because dermal fillers don’t treat dynamic wrinkles as well as Botox and Dysport, they aren’t really alternatives in most cases. (Richard Baxter, MD, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox or dysport are the best solutions for simple fine lines of the forehead. A brow lift surgery will also do the job for individuals that need a browlift.

</div><p>Why are you reluctant to try Botox or Dysport? Both medications are safe and effective for softening facial lines and wrinkles related to underlying facial muscle contraction. When injected by a qualified injector, you should head have a good result and a safe treatment experience.</p><p>There are some significantly more invasive surgical procedures that can eliminate forehead lines — brow lift with corrugator muscle disruption – it would make sense to try Botox or Dysport before embarking on a more invasive surgical procedure.</p><p>Seek out a board-certified plastic surgeon in your area for a comprehensive consultation, which should include discuss of Botox/Dysport and the surgical options available to you. (Scott C. Sattler, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>There are no good Botox alternatives</h4><p>Dysport is a similar medication that is used in the same way (injections), so if you are reluctant to try Botox, you will probably not want to try Dysport either. What is stopping you from trying Botox? I’ve heard so many reasons over the years, and most often they come from lack of knowledge.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2448" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Despite what seems to be a great deal of information about Botox, it is surprising how little some patients, and even some physicians who do not use it on a regular basis, know about it.</p><p>Botox is a safe predictable effective drug. The expense can be one of the limiting factors for some, but the prices have come down quite a bit, and are now about $10 – $12/ unit. The amount doctors inject now is also usually less than before, for a more natural look, so overall this results in more affordable price tag.</p><p>I would encourage you to talk to a qualified experienced physician about it and perhaps try a small amount in one area. Most likely, you will love the results. (Stella Desyatnikova, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox best for forehead wrinkles.</h4><p>There is another brand available (Dysport), and there is much less experience with this other product. So in the sense you mean, there is no alternative to Botox for forehead wrinkles. It is safe if expertly done, and there is no down time, and it only hurts a little, and it takes 5 minutes. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Dysport is a new drug available in the United States as an alternative to Botox. It has been used in Europe for many years. It works very similar to Botox. It is unclear as to if there is any advantage of one versus the other in terms of how long it takes to work or how long it lasts. (Jerome Potozkin, MD, Danville Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>While there are treatment alternatives for forehead wrinkles besides injections, Botox works so well in this area that it is almost without compare. A new competitor to Botox — Dysport — also works very well in this area and may be more affordable for some practices. (Harold J. Kaplan, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Alternatives to Botox</em></p><p>To treat wrinkles on the forehead and between the eyebrows that are caused by repetitive frowning and raising the brow, your only options right now are Botox or Dysport. These are both injectable treatments of a purified protein that relaxes the muscle so that it cannot make the wrinkle.</p><p>There is nothing else available that relaxes muscles to smooth lines. In order to relax the muscle, you have to deliver the treatment directly to the muscle. If you have very fine lines on your forehead, the kind that appear with age and sun exposure, creams such as retinoids, glycolic acids, and peptides may give you a subtle improvement and smoothing of the skin.</p><p>But creams, lotion, etc will not affect movement-related lines. (Jordana S. Gilman, MD, Washington Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Dysport may be a more cost effective option to botox</h4><p>Dysport may be a more cost effective option to botox. It is a type of botulinum toxin that has been recently approved for use in the glabellar region in the United States. It has been used in Europe with success and minimal side effects similar to Botox.</p><p>It might be a less expensive alternative for you and your physician might offer some discounts to use this product in lieu of traditional Botox. (Scott Trimas, MD, Jacksonville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox Injection Alternate Treatments</h4><p>Botox injection is appropriate for overactive muscles around the eye and on the forehead. To minimize the need for Botox, one recommendation is to improve the quality of the skin through effective topical regimens, such as Retin A, Hydroquinone, and chemical peels. (Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Revaleskin, is a skin care line containing CoffeeBerry, one of the strongest natural antioxidants. It has been clinically proven to improve skin pigmentation, fine lines, wrinkles, and some of the effects of photo-aging. Definitely worth the splurge!
