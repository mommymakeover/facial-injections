</div><p>As a trained Facial Plastic surgeon who performs her own shots on a regular basis, I pride myself on seeing my own patients back as a way of constantly improving my own results and making sure my patients are pleased with their outcomes.</p><p>I routinely request patients to return at 2-3 weeks after their shots, especially if it’s their first time with me, to perform a touch-up as needed and get them to their ideal end-point.</p><p>I believe many medical spas “bargain-basement pricing” to draw a large customer base–however, with this volume of patients, it also encourages over-dilution of the product because many of those customers won’t return to the practice when their botox stops working at 6 weeks or their results aren’t ideal.</p><p>Although it may be “cheaper” it ultimately may end up costing much more in other ways!Our pricing for Botox currently is in the range of $12-15/unit–average in the Atlanta market.</p><p>Because we have a very loyal and regular patient base, many of our patients often get discounts in addition to this because they obtain loyalty points from Allergan for their consistent return. (Anita Sethna, MD, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of Botox is variable depending upon the location and who is Performing the shots. The average price ranges from $10 to 16 dollars per unit. Some offices charge by the area, and some offices charge by the unit.</p><p>For transparency sake, we charge by the unit so that patient’s understand exactly what they’re paying for. It’s best to shop quality not price since this is your face. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There is a great range of fees for Botox shots. In order to get reliable results, with a minimal chance of eyelid drooping, you should consult with an experienced Dermatologist or Plastic Surgeon. Once you are satisfied that you have found such a Doctor, you may discuss fees with him/her.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1727" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-aec967d40d356933126649b0e03750ff">

</div><p>We charge $14,00 per unit. in our Offices in Chicago, Palos Heights and Park Ridge, Illinois. From time to time we have specials, which we advertise on our website. (Eugene Mandrea, MD, Chicago Dermatologist)</p><p>The cost of Botox shots depends on many variables. When my patient elects to receive Botox in conjunction with Laser Skin Resurfacing, I often inject the Botox for free 1 week prior to the laser treatment.</p><p>If a patient is getting a combined Botox and Filler treatment, I would then give a package rate. Botox parties are a great way to introduce patients to this excellent treatment in an affordable fashion.</p><p>Be careful of Botox offered at a low price, because this could signal that a physician is new at using Botox, or that the Botox may be diluted.

Gordon, MD, FACS, FAAO, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1728" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-46a7d68de0a0382e26b3962f4469d5d5">

</div><p><i>How much does Botox cost in Sydney</i></p><p>Botox is charged either as Units or per area. In my practice I charge by the unit and the amount of unit varies from person to person depending on the type of result required. Cost in Sydney varies from 10 to 20 $ per unit.</p><p>Since in Australia it is Illegal to use the trade names such as Botox or Dysport but have to use terms such as ‘anti wrinkle’ shots it gets confusing for the consumer. Since 1 Botox unit = 3 or 4 Dysport units, a statement such as ‘ anti wrinkle shots from $ 4 per unit’ should not be assumed to be Botox.</p><p>Always ask the Doctor whether it is Dysport or Botox. (Naveen Somia, MBBS, PhD, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Hey there I charge Botox treatments by the area, so one area is $350, two areas is $600, and three areas is $825. We do have specials running every month for injectables, so the price can be lower depending the on the discount special.(Henry Mentz, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1729" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h4>Botox and Brilliant Distinctions loyalty program</h4><p>Botox is generally charged by the unit or by the area, depending on your local market. Ideally people are charged by the unit so they are only paying for what they get, but either way, the most important factor is going to an experienced injector.</p><p>In most metropolitan areas, the average charge ranges from $10-15 per unit. Most important is having an experienced injector, as your results can vary greatly depending on who injected you, so a good injector may use less Botox to get similar results.</p><p>Botox looks easy to inject, but not all injectors are created equal! Keep in mind that if you join the manufacturer’s loyalty program (Brilliant Distinctions), you will qualify for a rebate and often get coupons towards your next treatment of Botox or Juvederm (their hyaluronic acid filler).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1730" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>This helps tremendously if you become a long term user, like most people. (Roxanne Sylora, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are two ways that Botox costs are determined. The first way is by the area treated and the second way is by the cost per unit of Botox. I prefer to charge by the unit.</p><p>I tell my patients that the more muscle in a region, the more Botox you will need. The goal is to use the minimum amount of Botox to obtain the maximum result as most patients I meet do not want to have that “frozen” look.</p><p>The first shot is carefully mapped and documented. The patient is seen back in the office in several weeks time to evaluate the result. If it is determined that more Botox is needed this may be given at this time or at the next injection in three months time.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1731" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The cost of Botox per unit will vary according to the area where you live. In the San Francisco bay region this will vary from $12-$20 per unit. I would furthermore suggest that you go to a board certified plastic surgeon of dermatologist to obtain the best results. (Donald M. Brown, MD (retired), San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox Cost: Beware of Deals</h4><p>With the proliferation of medical spas and the number of people who perform shots and have little understanding of the structures that lie under the skin of the face and neck, just remember that this is your face you are talking about, and the greatest deal is almost always too good to be true!</p><p>I am always reminded of my experience with a CRNA (nurse anesthetist) who works with plastic surgeons and tried to cut corners to get her Botox and ended up with many divots in her face.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1732" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d8ace6a67b21721f2ef7d633adea7cca">

</div><p>Clearly, this was not Botox, and I have also encountered many patients” stories that are consistent with practitioners watering down their Botox. Whether the pricing is by units/zones/etc, find someone who you trust and who understands the structures underlying the skin.</p><p>Some people find Botox to be a “easy” procedure. I think that, just like most cosmetic procedures, the quality of your Botox result depends on the injector. Don’t short change yourself. (Robert J. Chiu, MD, Pittsburgh Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>The cost of botox vary greatly by provider</h3><p>In short: it varies greatly. Location, experience, and credentials of the practitioner can all factor into cost. In Portland, the cost is usually about $14/unit when a physician performs your injections and much less (down to $10/unit) if a PA or NP performs your injection.</p><p>For a 25 unit dose of Botox, that would be $350 – $250. However, cost should only be one factor in your decision. If you go with the lowest price, you may be getting someone who is inexperienced, or is not a doctor.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1726" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Technically, PAs and NPs need to perform procedures under the auspices of a physician or medical director. These doctors are often “absentee” medical directors who provide little if any supervision. From a safety perspective, I would stay with a board-certified physician such as those you find here on the realself website for best results.</p><p>Although Botox is very effective, there are some potential complications that are best avoided. (Michael M. Kim, MD, Portland Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox — $14/unit, in our office – advanced injection techniques</strong></p><p>Please consider other factors, such as the experience and skill of the injector, in addition to price. I am a board-certified dermatologist, and I have been injecting Botox since 2006. I will evaluate your face during our consultation, both while you are animating (making expressions) and at rest.</p><p>I customize each treatment for your particular needs. I also spend time educating my patients so they know what to expect. In our office, botox is $14/unit. The consultation is complimentary.
