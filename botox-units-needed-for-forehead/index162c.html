It Varies from Patient to Patient</em></p><p>The amount of botox needed to treat transverse forehead wrinkles varies from patient to patient and depends on several variables.</p><p>These include the patient’s athletic goals and the strength of the frontalis muscle. The frontalis muscle is an elevator of the brow and is responsible for the development of transverse forehead wrinkles.</p><p>When transverse forehead wrinkles are eliminated completely, brow sag can be a potential complication. This should always be a consideration when treating forehead wrinkles. For this reason, it’s appropriate to be conservative during the initial phases of treatment.</p><p>In the majority of patients the forehead can be adequately treated with 20 to 25 units of botox. This may vary depending on the patient’s aesthetic goals. It’s important that these goals be discussed with the provider before proceeding.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3308" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>This will ultimately lead to a higher level of patient satisfaction. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox Units for Horizontal Forehead Lines</i></p><p>There isn’t a specific amount I can suggest because the needs of every patient are different. The units of BOTOX® needed will vary depending on how deep your forehead lines are, and how many wrinkles need to be addressed.</p><p>Administering too much BOTOX® will run the risk of making the eyebrows look droopy. If the existing lines are already pretty deep, you may want to consider a dermal filler instead. (Michael W. Niccole, MD, Orange County Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>25 units.</strong></p><p>Of course, everyone is different, but this is the dose that we use for most patients in New York City. Others use a little less, but I believe that if you use more, it lasts longer. (George J.

</div><p><em>Everyone is different</em></p><p>As much as you need to improve the lines without dropping your brows. Everyone is different: different age, skin thickness, forehead height, is there redundancy of wrinkles?, etc, etc.</p><p>Therefore, go to a board certified dermatologist, or plastic surgeon who can give you YOUR correct answer. (Mary P. Lupo, MD, New Orleans Dermatologist)</p><p><strong>Botox for horizontal forehead lines</strong></p><p>Frown lines between the eyebrows should probably be injected along with the forehead to reduce the risk of dropping the eyebrows with forehead injections alone. Since you have never had Botox to the forehead, I would start with about 10 units.</p><p>You should be aware that if your forehead muscles are continuously working to keep your eyebrows up (we can usually tell when this is occurring), even 10 units to the forehead only could drop your brows. (Bryan K. Chen, MD, San Diego Dermatologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3310" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You would need to consult with a plastic surgeon in your area to determine how many units would be needed to treat your problem. Generally though, about 20 – 25 units are needed to treat the forehead. (Edmond A. Zingaro, MD, San Francisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is a wonderful choice for forehead wrinkles especially if they are relatively superficial and present when you look up but not while you’re sitting still without facial expression…of course the amount depends on the severity of the wrinkles and the size of your forehead…those with a high forehead obviously need more…</p><p>generally somewhere in the range of 5-6 units to much more…and don’t hesitate to go for a low dose to start…forehead muscles not too strong…not like the muscles between your eyes that will usually need more…a great way to make you look younger and more relaxed… (Ken Landow, MD, Las Vegas Dermatologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3311" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>As I am not examined you, I can write generally you need 25 Units for Horizontal Forehead wrinkles . (Jhonny Salomon, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox in the forehead varies</h5><p>Different amounts of Botox are used to help the forehead. A careful exam can delineate the reasons for your wrinkles. I have used as little as 2 units in the forehead or as many as 30 in a man.</p><p>Botox in your forehead limits your ability to lift your eyebrows, so it needs to be used with caution after an exam. The results can be outstanding in the hands of an experienced injector. (Keith Denkler, MD, Marin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox for horizontal forehead lines</b></p><p>We will usually start with a low dose of Botox to the forehead, most commonly 10 units. The forehead muscles elevate the eyebrows so if a high dose of Botox is given, the eyebrows can drop.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3312" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>This can give a tired or aged appearance. (William Andrade, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Although I have put as many as 20 units for the forehead horizontal lines, I often start with 10 units so that I do not depress the brows too much. It is easy to add a little bit more and I will do so in increments of a few units to get the desired results.</p><p>If I am using higher dosages of Botox in the four head, then I will also treat the Brows depressor muscles to get a gentle brow lift to counter any brow depression that I may get from my forehead injection. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>How Many Botox Units in the Forehead</b></p><p>The forehead is treated commonly with Botox but it is actually one of the more difficult areas to treat. The problem is that too much Botox in the forehead will smooth away the lines but will cause the undesired effect of a lowering of the brow.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3313" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>That is why it is much better to start with a conservative amount of Botox to the forehead. I typically start with a low dose ranging from 5-10 units. If needed, it is easy to add a bit more Botox two weeks later.</p><p>When treating the forehead, I also like to treat the lateral brow with 2.5 units of Botox per side to help provide a brow lift. It is also usually best to treat the glabella or frown area together with the forehead. (Richard Ort, MD, Lone Tree Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>For many people forehead Botox can give a very natural and beautiful relaxation of the muscles that are causing those pesky horizontal lines. The main concern I have with a new client inquiring about forehead Botox is that those muscles may be working really hard to keep your eyelids out of your visual field.</p><p>You may not even really know that you are “compensating” in that way. It is very important to chose an expert who can help you determine whether you are even a candidate for forehead Botox or whether you may be better off just focusing on a “brow lift” with injections around the eyebrows and leaving the forehead alone. (Quenby Erickson, DO, FAAD, FACMS, Chicago Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>How Many Botox Units are Needed for Forehead Lines</strong></p><p>You need to see someone who is an expert injector. Hopefully that person will then determine if you want some expressivity in your forehead after the Botox takes effect or whether you want a smooth forehead that does not move.</p><p>Next they should look at the position and depth of your wrinkles as well as the position of you brows in relation to your eyes. All of this will determine how much you need. The range can be as little as 8 units and go up to about 40 units for the forehead. (Brian Windle, MD, Kirkland Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3315" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Every individual varies for the amount or units of Botox needed. It is also suggested that if you just treat the forehead area, that your glabella, or “11’s” ( lines in between your eyebrows) are also treated to help with symmetry.</p><p>One thing also to consider is the dilution that is placed in the Botox itself. I would recommend you schedule a consult with a certified injector or MD to help discuss the best treatment plan for you. (Peter J. Capizzi, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>This can vary patient to patient. It sounds like you have a forehead that is relatively more active than the typical. I would say likely somewhere from 15-20 units for your forehead but cannot answer without seeing you.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind is that the deep wrinkles at rest will not go away. That is becasue those are already set in. Botox stops the muscle movement so it will allow the wrinkles to not worsen but those deep ones that are there when you are at rest will not go away.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3316" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The best way to treat those is with a combination of fat transfer and laser. (Benjamin Caughlin, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Forehead wrinkles</h4><p>Normally we use 12 to 16 units on the forehead depending on the patient. Treatment is individualized per patient depending on the depth and the amount of wrinkles. (Lois Wagstrom, MD, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox for Forehead Lines </em></p><p>The frontalis muscle (which causes horizontal forehead lines) is the only muscle that elevates the eye brows, so over treating this muscle can lead issues such as depressed brows. In my practice, I like to treat conservatively, with 8-10 units, and then have patients back in 1-2 weeks to add more if needed. (Samuel Hetz, MSc, MD, Ottawa Physician)</p><p><i>Botox to treat forehead lines</i></p><p>We have only 1 muscle that elevates our brows and 5 muscles to depress them.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3317" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-614c45bb03f5a1ab883cf69378a6c227">

</div><p>The frontalis muscle which causes forehead lines is the one that elevates the brow. Overtreating this muscle with Botox can lead to brow ptosis. I treat the forehead conservatively and treat the brow depressor as that will improve the forehead lines by unloading the activity on the forehead muscle.</p><p>Better to start conservative on the forehead and follow up in 2 weeks for possible touch up or minor addition if needed than to have drop brows. (Bernard S. Salameh, MD, Bowling Green Physician)</p><h5>Botox for the Forehead</h5><p>Using Botox in the forehead is truly an art because one must balance improvement in forehead lines with maintaining the normal shape and height of the eyebrows. The amount necessary is tough to estimate since it varies widely across patients.</p><p>I usually inject 1 unit at a time spaced apart in the frontalis muscle, more centrally than laterally. Too much injection centrally may cause the central brow to drop and create a “scowl”. Too much placed laterally will cause the brows to become flatter and lower with more bunching up of upper eyelid skin. (Anand D. Patel, MD, Brookfield Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Be careful with Botox in the forehead</h5><p>Botox in the forehead can soften those horizontal lines; however, if you put too much Botox in the forehead, your eyebrows can drop (making your upper eyelids heavy). In fact, your etched-in lines are probably a sign that you depend on your forehead to help you open your eyes.</p><p></p>

</div>This means that you will be extremely sensitive to unwanted side effects from Botox. You may want to consider a combination of filler as well as a very light dosing of Botox. (Melissa Chiang, MD, FAAD, Houston Dermatologic Surgeon)
<p><em>Achieving a smoother forehead that still moves.</em></p><p>Treating the horizontal forehead wrinkles with botox or xeomin requires special consideration due to the risk of achieving that undesired frozen look or droopy eyebrows. To get a smoother forehead that avoids these complications your plastic surgeon must judge the strength and location of your wrinkles and then judge how much to administer and where to place it.</p><p>My mantra is that you can always add a little more after two weeks if necessary but you can’t take it away! So, I try to be somewhat conservative with a new patient and explain that they may need a small touchup at two weeks without charge.</p><p>My usual dose range is between about 13 and 20 units. More for deeper stronger wrinkles and generally more for males than females. (Jon A. Perlman, MD, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
