<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Most common areas for Botox are Forehead, crow’s feet, and the lines in-between the brows (glabella).</p><p>Patients usually require 50-60 units.</p><p>Botox can range from 10-14$/UNIT (Chaitali Nangrani, MD, The Woodlands Family Physician)</p><p>The price for a Botox treatment is variable and usually depends on the number of Botox Units used.</p><p>The number of Units used is influenced by the desired effect, the amount of current animation, and the strength of the muscles.</p><p>For new patients, however, the exact dosing is often discovered through a trial and error process.</p><p>Some rough guidelines are:</p><ul>
<li>Forehead: 16 units</li>
<li>Crowfeet (around eyes): 8 units per side</li>
<li>Glabella (between eyes): 18 units</li>
</ul><p>The price in my practice is $12 a Unit, however, new patients receive a discount on their first session.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1568" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-46a7d68de0a0382e26b3962f4469d5d5">

</div><p>A detailed examination will help delineate your treatment options. Consultation with a surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery would be the next best step. (David Tauber, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox pricing varies depending on the location and experience of the injector. Most physicians that I know price Botox treatment by the number of units used although some do charge a flat fee per treatment area.</p><p>In the Miami/South Florida market, which is where I practice, the cost of Botox varies from $12-$17 on average. Typically, patients required 16-24 units for frown lines, 8-10 units for the forehead, and 6-12 units per eye for crow’s feet.</p><p>The average Botox dose for these 3 treatment areas in my practice is between 40-50 units. (Shaun Patel, MD, Miami Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1569" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The price of Botox will vary depending on the areas being treated and the amount needed. In the glabella or crow’s feet , for example, up to 25 units may be used per area. With the price per unit varying from $11-15/ unit, this results in a cost range of $275-$375 for each area. (Burke Robinson, MD, FACS, Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of Botox can be priced either by unit or more commonly per area treated (such as the glabella, forehead, crow’s feet, chin, neck, jowl line, perioral area). The pricing can also be based on the practice and its location and who is injecting (sometimes a physician assistant may inject you and often the price may be lower).</p><p>We typically charge $400 for the first area, $750 for two areas, $950 for three areas, and $1350 for four areas (Only physicians inject at our office). Often times, Botox can be used to treat dimpling in the chin and to lift the jowl line a bit.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1570" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You can even use it to relax neck bands or lines in the chest. Although alot of practices other than dermatology and plastic surgery are inejcting neurotoxins, I normally caution patients and recommend to do their research before getting these procedures.</p><p>It is very important to go to a board certified dermatologist/plastic surgeon who is highly trained in these procedures and know how to treat the complications. It is your health! No discounted price for beauty is worth the risk of serious complications. (Diane Walder, MD, Miami Dermatologist)</p><p>The cost of Botox will vary depending on the experience for the injector in the Geographic area in which you were receiving Botox. It also depends on how many units you need to achieve the results that you’re looking for.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1571" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-4d00b3ef3635fb1c1c49c8df1a54d6d4">

</div><p>I charge $13/unit and am very comfortable injecting Botox in on the common areas such as the crows feet from lines for head. In addition I use Botox in other areas such as the masseters, palms, the axilla, the soles of the feet, lip lines, neck lines, the corners of the mouth and more. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox can be diluted by the actual physician so prices and units used may vary office to office. We have had many pt’s unhappy with the results from other clinics and confused when we give them positive results with the same amount of units used.</p><p>It’s always important to remember you usually get what you pay for, Currently we charge $15 per unit, amount of units depends on the site being injected.</p><p>The average for full correction (forehead, glabellar, crows feet) is around 48 to 50 units in my practice with results lasting on average 3-4 months. (Hannah Vargas, MD, Kansas City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1572" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><h5>Botox Cost Differences</h5><p>Botox is a safe neurotoxin that, when injected precisely into the correct muscles, can eliminate lines and wrinkles on your forehead, between your brows, and around your eyes. Botox is usually charged “per unit” and those costs can range from $15/unit to $10/unit.</p><p>To treat the frown lines between your eyebrows, 20-25 units will usually be required. If you’re looking to eliminate the crow’s feet around your eyes, 10-15 units per side will usually do the trick. Having said all that, I do think that my Botox patients are some of my happiest; they definitely think that it’s worth the price. (Ryan Marshall, DO, Missoula Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox cost on average $350-1500 per treatment session</h3><p>Botox can cost on average as much as $350-1500 per treatment depending upon the areas injected and how much the health care provider charges. Areas include the crow’s feet, glabella (area between the brows that causes furrows), and forehead, and the doctor injects each area with the number of units that he or she thinks is necessary to locally paralyze the muscles at that particular spot. (Jennifer L. Walden, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1573" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h4>Botox Cost in Denver</h4><p>Like most reputable practitioners, I charge for Botox by the unit, not by the treatment area. My current price for Botox is $12/unit. This has been my price for many years and I have not raised it, even though the manufacturer of Botox raises the price that we pay to purchase it every year.</p><p>I also offer a popular program called the Botox Smart Money Club for patients who wish to prepay for 100 units ahead of time at $10/unit. The typical amount of Botox that I use for the most common areas is as follows: frown lines 20 units, forehead 10 units, and crow’s feet 20 units.</p><p>Some people can get by with a bit less while some people need more for best results. My prices are not the highest in town but they are not the lowest in town either. I saw an ad on my shopping cart at the supermarket today for $9/unit at a massage center.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1574" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b84afbc2471436b99cf348a882e6f6e0">

</div><p>I certainly would not trust my face to a place like that but some people are lured by bargain basement prices. What I can offer my patients is twenty years experience, a professional setting, and a doctor who wants every patient to have the best possible result.</p><p>I personally do all the injections at my office. Our prices are competitive and we don’t give extra Botox units just to jack up the price.</p><p>If a patient has a less than perfect result, I want to see them back and will often give a small touch-up injection at no additional charge if needed.</p><p>For about the last year, I have been offering Xeomin to my patients as an alternative to Botox. Xeomin is FDA-approved to treat frown lines and gives the same results as Botox. It costs us slightly less to purchase it and we pass the savings on to our patients.</p><p>Currently we charge $11/unit for Xeomin and $9/unit for the Xeomin Smart Money Club. Many of my patients have switched to Xeomin and are very happy to save a little money with the same great results. (Richard Ort, MD, Lone Tree Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Cost of Botox and other considerations</b></p><p>Botox pricing is typically either per area (11s, forehead, crows) or per unit. There is some variability in the pricing and may depend on who is performing the injections, and in many cases, pricing is lower if it is not a Board Certified doctor performing the injections.</p><p>In some unscrupulous cases the price is lower if the Botox is imported from overseas and may not be authentic. This actually happens! Rest assured- if the office participates in Allergan’s Brilliant Distinctions reward program, the Botox is authentic and purchased directly from Allergan.</p><p>Charging per area is a challenge because some people need more than others because they have stronger muscles or a larger forehead, and sometimes people want a certain look- eyebrow lift (this requires more) or a more natural look with some movement remaining (this requires less).</p><p>So in offices charging per area, you may get less than you need if you are really strong, possibly pay for more than you need if you are one of the lucky ones that need less.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1575" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It is important that you get the dose that YOU need. I hope you are starting to realize that although everyone wants to know “how much will this cost me?” There are also some very important other questions to be asking, such as “who performs the injections?” “Is the doctor a board Certified Dermatologist or Plastic surgeon?” “Does the office participate in Brilliant Distinctions?” The difference in price to have the benefits of an excellent result and overall experience with your Botox is minimal.</p><p>Typically people spend between $500-800 per treatment for treatment on the face or neck. (Quenby Erickson, DO, FAAD, FACMS, Chicago Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>How much does Botox cost at Facial Focus Cosmetic Surgery?</h5><p>The cost of Botox(R) at my practice depends on several factors, including the cost to purchase the product from producer Allergan, and any additional products/procedures purchased concomitantly (I offer packages to lower the cost versus purchasing individually).</p><p>If you have never had any neuromodulator therapy before, I generally recommend starting with the upper 1/3 of the face first (crows feet and glabella +/- forehead lines). Patients will notice a significant improvement in these areas within 3-5 days and I feel this offers the best initial value without the risk of altering a patients smile or other facial expressions.</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Crow’s feet (12-15U/eye = 24-30U total) Cost</strong>: $275-450</li>
<li>
<strong>Glabella (12-20U total) Cost</strong>: $150-300</li>
<li>
<strong>Forehead lines (12-30 total) Cost</strong>: $150-450</li>
<li>
<strong>Total</strong>: $575-1200</li>
</ul><p>Keep in mind that these prices span a large range in total units administered with prices ranging from $12-15/U.</p><p>Each patient is unique and there are several other neuromodulators available that can be administered for additional cost savings.
