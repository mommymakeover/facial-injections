<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Typically, there are two types of payment structures for Botox. One, is there is cost per unit and depending on how many units are used determines your final price. The other is based on the area being treated.</p><p>The most common areas are the crows feet, Glabella (known as the frown lines or glabellar lines), and the forehead. There are other areas that can be treated too depending of your physician’s approach. In this scenario the cost would be the same for each patient regardless of how many units of Botox is utilized to achieve the desired result in that area.</p><p>Botox by the unit can average anywhere from $10 to $17 a unit. To give some perspective, the average person needs about 20 units to treat horizontal forehead lines, 2 to 10 units to treat crows feet around the eyes and 25 units to treat the glabella (men typically need more).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1586" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b527d53b3c9f8347f60fc0f1d1176e70">

</div><p>The cost of Botox treatment fluctuates based on criteria such as your geographical location and the expertise of the injector. Your location is a huge influence on the cost of the treatment. Generally, the price will run higher in major metropolitan areas such a as New York or Los Angeles.</p><p>This due to the increased overhead cost associated with these areas. Providers with specialized training and more experience and expertise usually charge. The average cost would be between $500 and $700 for all 3 areas (Glabella, forehead, and crow’s feet) to be treated.</p><p>Keep in mind that this is an estimate that vary based on different factors such as the ones specified. (Pooja Malik, MD, Cherry Hill Family Physician)</p><h5>Cost for Botox Varies</h5><p>Clinics charge differently from each other. However, they almost always charge for Botox in a couple of ways. One is by “area” and the other is by “unit”. Personally, charging by “area” may seem deceitful as it may lead to cheating.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1587" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>The clinic could potentially use different ratios and dilutions they want so that the patient will not know how much he or she is receiving. Also, the possibility of cross-contamination is high since the clinic will be using the same vial repeatedly for more than a few patients.</p><p>The most accepted way of Botox charging is by “unit”. Allergan has begun distributing Botox vials of 50 units or 100 units. Based from my own experience and practice, this would be the typical Botox amount for average patients.</p><h3>A 50-unit vial of Botox can take care of the following:</h3><ul>
<li>10 units per side for Crow’s Feet</li>
<li>20-25 units for Glabellal lines</li>
<li>10 units for the Forehead</li>
</ul><p>This amount will allow significant wrinkle reduction while also allowing you to retain facial animation.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1588" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b4ce11390ef852fc1df830de3566001b">

</div><p>However, some patients may have strong motor activity and more Botox may be required to achieve the ideal result. The usual unit charge will vary around the country. It can be estimated anywhere around $9 to $20 per unit.</p><p>As for me , I tell the nurse 1/4, 1/2 or 3/4 dose to draw up for me</p><p>This means 25, 50, or 75 units of Botox. (Robert W. Sheffield, MD, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of Botox in the Austin, Texas area is usually somewhere between $10 and $14 per unit (average is closer to $11/unit). I have seen the occasional free raffles for, say, 20 units, and the occasional sales for a little cheaper than $10 per unit, and have seen a rare few charging more than $14 per unit.</p><p>The actual cost of treatment will depend on how many units you would need injected, which depends on your anatomy (facial muscle strength, etc), the areas that concern you and you want treated, as well as the overall outcome you desire from the botox.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1589" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Usually (plus or minus a few units), I use 18 to 22 units in the glabellar lines, 8 to 12 on each of the crows feet, and 8 to 12 in the frontalis. Total is usually 36 to 48 units (plus or minus). I recommend finding an aesthetics practice where you can have a doctor to do a formal evaluation of your skin and goals and develop a treatment plan to achieve your goals. (Billy Ledbetter, MD, Austin Physician)</p><h3>Las Vegas Botox cost</h3><p>We charge based on the area treated, and use generally around 20 units per site. This seems to work well for most of our patients and it lasts around 6 months. The three most commonly treated areas, or sites, are the glabellar (bridging between eyebrows, also know as the “11s”), the forehead and the crows’ feet.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1590" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I charge $15.00 a unit if I perform the treatment, but the cost drops significantly if multiple sites are treated ($10.00 a unit for the second site and $5.00 a unit for the third site).</p><p>I also have an injector, Judi, and she charges $10.00 a unit for the first site, with additional savings for multiple sites. (Curt Samlaska, MD, Las Vegas Dermatologist)</p><h5>What is the price for Botox?</h5><p>Most offices that I am aware of charge by the unit. The most common areas of the face that are treated with Botox include the glabellar lines, the forehead, and the sides of the eyes (Crow’s feet).</p><p>This typically requires between 40 and 60 units of Botox. Most offices charge between $10 and $15 per unit, some may be a bit higher. (Todd C. Miller, MD, Newport Beach Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1591" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p><i>Average Price for Botox in Tampa Florida</i></p><p>In my office, I am the plastic surgeon injector and we charge $13 per unit. To do the glabella frown lines or “11”s it may take 20 units or more, so do the math. (Karen E. Wells, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The cost of Botox varies widely from practice to practice and is mainly dependent on the skill of the injector and the economics of the market where you are located. Pricing is typically either listed as “per unit” or “per area.”</p><p>The most common “areas” for Botox injection are the forehead, the glabella (in between the eyebrows), and the “Crow’s feet” area around the eyes.</p><p>It can be difficult to determine what kind of value you are receiving when the price is given per area, so I always recommend asking your injector how many units you will be receiving in an area in order to be able to compare to those practices where the Botox is priced per unit.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1592" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In many markets, $11-15 per unit can be a common range, but in some markets the range can extend up to $20 per unit or more. Each of the three previously mentioned “areas” typically require 10-20 units of Botox, but this can vary from patient to patient.</p><p>In addition to the dollar amount, you should take into account the skill and training of the injector. A board-certified physician injector with specialized training in facial aesthetics may have slightly higher prices, but he or she will have the knowledge and expertise to give you the best individualized treatment with the lowest risk of complications or inadequate results. (Jordan Cain, MD, Frisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox Cost can Vary Tremendously</i></p><p>The cost for Botox can vary quite a bit and depends on multiple factors. Ultimately it depends on how the provider is charging you for the Botox. The most commonly utilized practice is by the unit or per area.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1593" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It is helpful however to know how many units you are getting because it allows a better comparison from place to place. There are a couple of things you need to be aware of</p><p>1) Go to an experience provider. The old adage “You get what you pay for”, certainly applies to any procedure you are contemplating on the face. In New Jersey, the average cost for Botox is between $12 and $16 per unit. While there are certainly bargain places and groupon deals where the cost is substantially less, remember this is your face we are talking about.</p><p>Botox injections require an understanding of the anatomy as well as the interplay of opposing muscle groups. Go to an expereinced provider</p><p>2) Make sure you are getting Botox or one of the other FDA approved botulinum toxins such as Dysport and Xeomin. In my experience, I prefer Botox and Dysport as I have had consistent results with these two products.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1594" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>3) Follow up is important especially if you are getting Botox for the first time with a provider.</p><p>Some places will add additional units, if needed, for a nominal fee. Most clients will require 20 to 25 units in the glabellar lines or the area between the brow. Men can require more as much as 40 units.</p><p>Forehead region requires anywhere from 10 to 20 units. Most people like a natural look, so in my practice I tend to be more conservative knowing that I can add more. People are reluctant to get Botox because they are afraid to get the deer in the headlight look.</p><p>However, when injected properly, it can remove years from the face. Finally, the crow’s feet or smile lines are typically injected with anywhere from 10 to 15 units per side.</p><p>Depending on how many areas you perform as well as the region of the country and experience of the provider, expect to pay anywhere from $300 to $700. (Hardik Soni, MD (not currently practicing), Summit Emergency Medicine Physician)</p><p>We charge Botox Cosmetic by the area. The three most common areas are the crow’s feet, the lines in-between the brows (glabella), and the forehead. According to the FDA, the forehead is considered an “off-label” use.</p><p>I typically use 60 units for those 3 areas and charge $650, meaning a little over $10/unit. I personally do all of my own injections so that I can monitor your progress and make sure the standard dosages we typically use are right for you.</p><p>As a board-certified ophthalmic plastic surgeon, it is very important to me to form a relationship with every patient, so I would never have anyone else inject our patients other than myself.
