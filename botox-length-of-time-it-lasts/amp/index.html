<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Botox generally lasts three to four months. After the first two to three treatments, patients may require touchups that less frequently.</p><p>I have many patients who come in every 3 months and some prefer to stretch it out to 6 or 9 months for touchups and it works well.</p><p>Consult with a Board Certified Dermatologist or Plastic Surgeon to determine the appropriate treatment regimen for your individual case. (Donna Tran, DO, Webster Physician)</p><p>Botox injections typically last 3 – 4 months but it varies for each patient.</p><h4>The length of time that Botox will last depends on a number of factors including:</h4><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_809" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</ol><p>Botox injections also tend to dissipate faster in athletic patients. The body’s healing abilities will work more quickly to eliminate the solution. (Anil Sharma, MD, Edmonton Otolaryngologist)</p><p>Botox usually lasts about 4-6 months. There can be variations between each individual person, but the average is around 4 months. The amount injected can make a difference as well. If a conservative amount is injected or if the product is over diluted, the product may not last as long as it should.</p><p>It is important to find an experienced and reputable injector with a good understanding of the facial anatomy. This will ensure great results and minimize the possibility of complications.

</div><p>Botox typically lasts 3-4 months. With continued treatments, the effects of botox can sometimes last up to 6 months.</p><p>This varies from person to person, as some people have stronger muscles and may need more frequent treatments. (Bryan W. Rubach, MD, Naperville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Longevity of Botox</h3><p>The results of Botox classically last 3-4 months. Tho every patient is different. Patients can report results lasting anywhere from 8 weeks to 6 months. It’s time to get retreated when you can start to animate and make full expression. (Amy Krachman, DO, New Jersey Physician)</p><p><strong>Ups and Downs of BOTOX</strong></p><p>This is a bit variable but the best answer is 3 months. The variables are if you are a long time botox user, if you workout intensely, and if you have certain medical conditions.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_811" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-7732a6bae8be1022dc3a3df27362b253">

</div><p>Long time botox users either get a habituation to the product where they need it more or sometimes the real long time users get atrophy of the injected muscle and it actually last a bit longer.</p><p>Big time exercisers will burn through the product a week or two quicker. This is likely just an increased metabolism. Medical conditions such as HYPERthyroidism have been shown to decrease the length of effectiveness. (Benjamin Caughlin, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox and length of time</h4><p>On average I find that botox lasts between 3.5 – 4 months. The greater amount of units utilized (to a point) does last longer. Meaning if the glabellar region in a female is treated with 20 units compared to utilizing only 12 units, the 20 unit botox patient will last longer.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_812" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There is one study done out of Baylor showing that zinc may increase the duration of botox. While this study was small and larger studies would be needed, a little zinc may help a slight touch.</p><p>Also, patients that just “don’t want to move” and I do have some of those, may be right at 3 months, where as patients that don’t mind a little movement towards the end, may be able to last 5-6 months.</p><p>By relaxing the muscle, you do protect from getting the deeper static wrinkles, even if done every 5 months. (Raminder Saluja, MD, Huntersville Ophthalmologist)</p><p>Patients see visible results for approximately 3 to 4 months’ post treatment. However, there is always the potential for individual variability. Some patients see the results drop off closer to the 3 month mark while others continue to see results for up to 5 months.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_813" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>With that said your physician can also create longer lasting results if you have these muscles are injected regularly. Botox will have more impact on the muscles that are still not fully active. Also, you learn to animate and use different muscles.</p><p>This also makes your result more pleasing. Patients with heavier frown lines tend to have stronger muscles and in turn tend to see the motion of the muscle return quicker than those with less bulky muscles in the area between the brows.</p><p>In some men and even some women with prominent muscles, it may only last 2-3 months. (Pooja Malik, MD, Cherry Hill Family Physician)</p><p>Botox typically lasts approximately 3-4 months, but can vary patient to patient. Results can last longer if more units are used. (Alan N. Larsen, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_814" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Botox works at the nerve endings where they meet the muscle fibers – called the nerve endplate. It cleaves a protein involved in sending the message from the nerve to the muscle. The duration depends on the dose mainly, but theoretically would also depend on how fast the nerve endings recover – which could vary in different individuals.</p><p>It tends to last longer in older patients in my experience. Overall, 2-5 months is a realistic expectation. (Derek Norcom, MD, Portland Physician)</p><p>I have used botox for the last 14 years in the UK. The average length of time botox lasts is 12-16 weeks. I tell patients 12 weeks. You don’t suddenly wake up with wrinkles, but after 8-10 weeks you will gradually notice movement re-occurring.</p><p>Its important to truely benefit from botox and its therapeutic benefits reschedule at 12 weeks. The procedure is repeated and long term the muscles atrophy providing a beautiful age preventing result.

</div><p>There have been many studies on the length of time Botox does last. Initially, Botox will last a good three or four months but after two years of continuous use, Botox can last much longer and we have our ongoing patients that do Botox regularly coming in two or three times a year. (David A. F. Ellis, MD, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is FDA indicated to last up to 3 months. While many people still see the effects of it after that, it’s best to get treated every 3 months so new wrinkles don’t get a chance to form. (Justin Harper, MD, Columbus Physician)</p><p><strong>Botox Duration of Action</strong></p><p>On average, Botox tends to last 3-4 months after injection. Dilution strength, unit amount, age, gender, anatomical location of injection and muscle density can all affect duration of action. (Praven Chetty, MD, Kelowna Physician)</p><p>Botox lasts between 3-6 months. This varies based on your anatomy, physiology, and the amount and area(s) injected. (Jeffrey M. Joseph, MD, Newport Beach Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>Every Patient is different 2-6 months is the range; average is 3-4 months. Your doctor can evaluate your areas of concern and take before and after photos. This will help you really see the difference in those areas! Keeping your botox up and having those muscles injected regularly will keep the results of botox/dysport! The number of units injected has direct correlation with the effectiveness of your Botox injections.</p><p>The units needed per patient usually ranges between 25-55 units. (Chaitali Nangrani, MD, The Woodlands Family Physician)</p><p>It is dependent upon a few factors but usually 3-4 months. The more consistently you have Botox injections the more you can usually space the injections out and they can last up to 6 months. (Walton Montegut, MD, Newport Beach Physician)</p><p>For most patients Botox lasts for about 3 – 4 months. Every patient is different so it is hard to say exactly, but we recommend patients come in around the 3 month mark for new Botox injections. After you get Botox injections a few times you will notice how your body reacts to it and how often you will need to see your plastic surgeon for new Botox injections. (Jimmy S. Firouz, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Generally, Botox lasts around 3-4 months. Various factors including strength of the affected muscles, individual metabolism, injector technique, and how long a patient has been getting Botox for can all affect its longevity. Often, the longer a patient has been getting Botox for the longer the results will last; results may last longer if more units are injected as well. (Kory Kitagawa, MD, Honolulu Dermatologist)</p><p>It can be difficult to predict how long the results of BOTOX injections will last for a specific patient, but in general the treatment’s effects begin wearing off 3 to 4 months after the procedure. The number of units used influences the duration of the results.</p><p>Additionally, results may last longer for patients who have already had BOTOX treatments because facial muscles begin to atrophy with repeated use. That means they are less likely to create the dynamic wrinkles that BOTOX is meant to minimize. (Suzanne Bruce, MD, Houston Dermatologic Surgeon)</p></div>
