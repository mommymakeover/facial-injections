However, this does vary from to patient to patient. Once the Botox takes effects, your skin will appear more youthful and smooth.</p><p>Its recommended that you schedule follow-up’s every 4 months as the effect begins to wear off by then.</p><p>Longstanding surface wrinkles will take continued treatments for the muscles to relax sufficiently to repair the surface irregularities.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1016" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b527d53b3c9f8347f60fc0f1d1176e70">

</div><p>There are no limits as to how many times you may repeat this procedure.(Marvin F. Shienbaum, MD, Brandon Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Full benefit from Botox takes about a week. Some people respond sooner and have full effect in 3-4 days, however it can take up to 10 days in some people. The results usually last about 4 months but this is the average,meaning that in some people it lasts less and others longer.</p><p>Botox can be used for years without problems. (Cynthia Stolovitz, MD, Montreal Physician)</p><p>Botox injections for wrinkles in the forehead, between the eyes, and the crows feet is one of the most commonly performed plastic surgery procedures. Most patients see results within a few days or so, but it can be different from person to person.</p><p>Botox can last anywhere from three to six months. I have many patients that have been getting Botox injections for many years, and there are not any known problems with long term use at this point in time.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1017" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

However, complete results are seen in about 10 days. (David A. F. Ellis, MD, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox Kicks in Quickly, But Full Effect Takes Up To 1 Week</i></p><p>Typically one begins to feel the effects of Botox or Dysport within a day or two, but the full effect can take up to one week. To shorten the onset of action and to enhance the effects, I prescribe a series of post-treatment muscle exercises for the treated areas.</p><p>On average, botox lasts anywhere from three to five months when injected properly.

</div><p>The effects from Botox on crow’s feet can be seen after a few days, however it can take up to two weeks to see the full result. There is no limit to how many times a person can have Botox, it can safely be done approximately every 3-4 months for maintenance. (Ava Shamban, MD, Santa Monica Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Generally Botox takes about 3-5 days to take effect and will last 3 to 4 months in most cases. Make sure you go to a Board Certified physician who will use only fresh product and make sure to receive a detailed record of your treatment including how many units of Botox you received.</p><p>Make sure to participate in Brilliant Distinctions program. (John L. Burns Jr., MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>the clinical effect of Botox originally approved for diseases related to muscle spasm can be noted in as early as 2 days. </p><p>Botox, in its cosmetic use for facial wrinkles might have a more subtle or less noticeable one for that matter in the same span of time but in general the results should be noticeable within a week.</p><p></p>

</div>There are more complex topics such as resistance to Botox with a possible role for antibody formation in a rare subset of patients, yet a controversial topic that deserves a lengthier medical discussion. (Jacob Sedgh, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<p>I like to tell my patients to allow up to two weeks for Botox to take full effect, but most patients will notice a relaxing and softening of the treated areas beginning as early as 3-4 days and building over a two week time frame.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1020" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>I like to follow up with my new patients 2 weeks post-injection to ensure that they are satisfied with their results. After that, patients return as often as needed for touchups and to maintain their desired look. (Vu Ho, MD, Plano Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Most patients see their results in 3-4 days, but the full extent of the muscle strength reduction may take 10 days-2weeks. </p><p>Depending on the exact location where the substance is placed, the size of the muscle and the degree to activity in the muscle Botox lasts about 3-4 months.</p><p>Some years ago studies demonstrated that high doses of Botox do not necessarily relate to response longevity. As for continued use of Botox, well, it’s been used for cosmetic reasons since (about)1990. I’m not sure if there are any patients who have had it every three months since then, but there are no studies that indicate that it couldn’t be used every 3-4 months indefinitely.

</div><p>The full results of Botox on crow’s feet usually begin to show after about 5-12 days. Other neurotoxins may be shown quicker. The results vary from patient to patient but can last as long as 4 months. You can continue to use Botox as the results help you.</p><p>For conditions such as Blepharospam around the eyelids, if the results do no last after years of treatment, there are surgical options available. (Sean Paul, MD, Austin Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox results on crow’s feet can be seen from 1-4 days</h4><p>Botox is an excellent choice for facial rejuvenation for many patients. The typical patient will see results within 4 days, but occasionally early improvement can be noted within a day. Initially, the benefits last for approximately 4 months, but with regular treatments the results can last longer.</p><p>This lasting effect stems from the gradual weakening of the muscles (involved in creating the wrinkles).</p><p>I have been injecting some patients since 1997 who only require yearly treatments with Botox to maintain their appearance. (James R. Gordon, MD, FACS, FAAO, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>on average the effects of botox peak at 2 weeks…but depending on individual sensitivity optimal improvement may come as early as a week and rarely be delayed until 3 weeks…and it lasts about 3 months on average with the crow’s feet often being the first area to lose effectiveness…but the greatest news is that if you keep up your treatments then you can look forward to a lifetime of benefit…no maximum number of treatments at appropriate intervals… (Ken Landow, MD, Las Vegas Dermatologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1023" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Botox is a toxin that is injected in small amounts into muscles in the upper portion of the face to smooth the lines and wrinkles caused by contraction of these muscles during frowning or squinting.</p><p>Horizontal forehead lines, vertical lines between the eyebrows, and crows’ feet around the eyes can all be significantly reduced by injecting small amounts of this substance into the underlying muscles. Treatments take ten to twenty minutes and results can be expected in three to five days.</p><p>The effect usually lasts three to five months, at which time further injections may be needed to maintain results. (Gregory A. Wiener, MD, FACS, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Quickly with no limits</em></p><p>Within 3-4 days you will start to see the initial effects, and then by 12-14 days you will have full benefit. There is no limit to the number of times you may receive Botox, and it’s likely that consistent use will prevent future wrinkles from developing.

The price range is 200 to 350euros. (Bulent Cihantimur, MD, Turkey Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox starts working within 48 hours and has maximal effect in 7-10 days. It then lasts 3-4 months.
