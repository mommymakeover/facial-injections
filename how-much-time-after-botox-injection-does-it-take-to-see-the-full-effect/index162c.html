<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Patients begin to see the effects of injection of the muscles of facial expression with Botox three to four days after the injection.</p><p>The maximal effect of Botox is usually seen around two weeks after injection.</p><p>It is for this reason that we recommend that patients who have some initial concerns about their Botox injection wait until at least two weeks after the time of their injection to see the doctor for a post injection evaluation.</p><p>The duration of effect of Botox varies from patient to patient, and also depends on the muscles that are being injected, and the dosage used. We tell our patients that the effect of Botox can last for between three and six months.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_870" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>When the effect of the Botox wears off, the patient’s facial appearance returns to what it was prior to the Botox injection. There is no limit to how long a patient can use Botox for this indication. (Peter Lee, MD, FACS, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox Results and Timing</h5><p>Most patients notice a change as quickly as a few days, but based on the scientific studies, you should see the “final” results at about 10-14 days. This is when the muscles should be the weakest and you should have the least movement.</p><p>I often bring patients back at about the 2 week farm for a “recheck” or “touch-up” if necessary. Botox lasts, on average, about 3-4 months.</p><p>There are several factors that can change this. For example, if you exercise a lot, your Botox will likely wear of quicker than someone who doesn’t exercise.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_871" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Another factor might be how the botox was done and how concentrated the solution is.</p><p>At this point, there are no long term studies that show issues with long term Botox use. No long term side effects have been documented yet. (Tracy Evans, MD, FAAD, San Francisco Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox’s effect can usually be seen by day 7. Because there is a chance that the full effect takes 2 weeks, I will never do any touch ups before 2 weeks after day of injection. (Dysport usually takes effect in 24 hours.). (Azin Meshkinpour, MD, MPH, FAAD, Lake Forest Dermatologist)</p><p>You see the full benefit of Botox 2 weeks post-injections. Many of our patients maintain their Botox 24/7 to prevent active lines from creating passive lines. (Mark E. Mason, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_872" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><em>Onset of Botox</em></p><p>Currently it really depends on the formulation of botox. Some act faster than other but it takes a few days (3-4) to start seeing an effect. The maximum effect is seen at 2 weeks approximately but that also varies depending on the formulation, the patient, and the units of botox injected.</p><p>Typically the treatment lasts on average a total of 3 months and that time period varies also. (Raja Mohan, MD, Dallas Physician)</p><p>Unfortunately there are no universal numbers for dosage, onset, duration or frequency of treatments. According to the current literature, as well as what I see in my practice, the effects of Botox can usually be seen within 2-3 days of treatment.</p><p>Of course some patients will notice changes the same day where as others may have a delayed onset or even need a touch-up after 7-10 days. The key is to explain this to patient ahead of time in order to set appropriate expectations and improve satisfaction.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_873" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Along these same lines it’s helpful to explain to patients that the effects they see will likely be different from those of their friends because the facial muscle function/level of activity varies quite a bit across the board.</p><p>They should also be educated about potential side effects, such as levator paralysis, and informed that regardless of how effective the treatment, the effects are only temporary. This means that the majority of patients will need repeat treatments every 4-6 months but with caution to keep injections at least 3 months apart to avoid boosting the immune system. (Joshua Cox, MD, Webster Physician)</p><p>Most of the results from Botox will be seen within 1 week after treatment, although some people continue to see results up to 2 weeks. Results typically last 2-4 months depending on the amount and area treated. (Samuel Hetz, MSc, MD, Ottawa Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_874" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>BOTOX onset is typically between 2-5 days. Dysport has a more rapid onset of 1-3 days. Both these muscle relaxants (neuromodulators) peek at about 14 days. BOTOX clinical result lasts almost exactly 3 months (one week before or after) while dysport lasts longer by about two weeks.</p><p>I presented the results of a three year study combining minute amounts of lidocaine with epinephrine and bicarbonate to each of these medications. Botox lasted about 10 days longer and Dysport 13 days longer than with saline dilution alone.</p><p>Enjoy your day and be happy. (Robert J. Troell, MD, FACS, Las Vegas Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Many Botox patients will see results in the first 24 to 72 hours withthe complete effect in approximately 7 days. There is no limit to the length of time a patient may receive Botox. (Mark L. Eldore, MD, Tyler OB-GYN)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_875" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>In my practice my standard is that Botox will start to take effect anywhere between 7-10 days. Some patients will report that they have results within 5 days while others report that it did take 10 days.</p><p>Therefore initial results will differ from patient to patient. (Steven Zoellner, MD, Pinehurst Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox, Dysport and Xeomin all begin to work in 2 days, and are at their maximum effect in 7 days in most cases.</p><p>There is the rare patient who fails to respond, and the unusual patient who responds less well than others, but in most people these intervals apply.</p><p>The relaxation of muscle continues for 3 months, when gradually movement returns. If you receive another injection before the muscle contraction has completely recovered, the muscle will get weaker and smaller. If frequent injections are maintained, the wrinkles will grow less and less noticeable. (Gregg Kennedy, MD, Buford Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_876" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d87d550619663a1157fa2e6f7e0b1eb5">

</div><p>The full effect of Botox can take 10-14 days in some patients. There is no limit to receiving Botox injections, as long as you space them at least 3 months apart. (Peter N.

With only a few minutes of treatment, frown lines between the eyebrows, crow’s feet at the corner of the eyes, and forehead wrinkles are effectively treated.</p><p>Men and women of varying ethnicities can be treated with Botox® and will see a noticeable improvement within days. (Tamyra L. Rogers, MD, San Antonio Physician)</p><p><b>Botox takes about a week to kick in</b></p><p>Botox generally last 3 to 4 months and it takes about one week for it to start working. I tell patients the higher unit that is injected the results last longer (more towards the 4 months line). (Kami K.

</div><h5>Botox Effects: How Quick Can They Be Seen</h5><p>Botox generally takes effect within 5-7 days. Rarely, the effects can take 10 days to settle into the face. You will notice that the muscle action causing brow furrowing, crow’s feet and horizontal forehead lines lessen as Botox takes effect.</p><p>Subsequently, the resting lines associated with these movements fade away! The result is lifted brow position, a smooth forehead, no more 11 lines between the brows and softened crow’s feet around the eyes! (Raymond Westbrook, MD, Dallas Internist)</p><p>Botox can take up to two weeks to see full results. Many patients see the most change within three to seven days with a little more softening of fine lines and wrinkles around day fourteen.</p><p>Patients can have Botox placed every three months. Majority of patients have Botox placed every three to four months, before they fully return to their “baseline,” so that existing fine lines and wrinkles do not deepen and to prevent new ones from forming. (Spencer Berry, MD, Fargo Family Physician)</p><p>Botox is a neuromodulator that inhibits the communication between a nerve and its target tissue. In most cases, a muscle. This means it is treating dynamic wrinkles – wrinkles that occur with movement. Static wrinkles are present when there is no muscle contraction and may be softened by a neuromodulator but not necessarily eliminated.</p><p>Onset of action is typically 2-5 days after the injection with full effect seen by 10-14 days. Results will typically last 3-4 months. (Richard E. Moore, MD, Saint Louis Physician)</p><h5>Full benefit every time</h5><p>Botox completely goes away in 4-6 months. Except in the rare cases where antibodies develop to the molecule, you should receive a dose-dependent result every time it is used. Sometimes patients may think they didn’t get as much out of a treatment, but those can be based on anatomical injection differences and of course on the dose or number of units used. (Michael H. Swann, MD, Springfield Dermatologic Surgeon)</p></div>
