<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><b>When to expect Botox results</b></p><p>Botox is a purified protein used to address wrinkles associated with facial expression. The pivotal studies demonstrated that the peak effects of Botox are seen 14 days after the treatment and most people enjoy their results for 3-4 months.</p><p>That being said, some people start to see results as early as the next day. But I tell my patients to wait a full 2 weeks for full results. We have our patients return at that time to assess their results.</p><p>At that time additional units may be added if necessary. Please consult with a doctor for specific recommendations. (Alex Eshaghian, MD, PhD, Encino Physician)</p><h5>Its possible to start seeing results within a few days!</h5><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3216" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-098a335066c2c0ecb39ed88f1bb7ca70">

</div><p>Generally results can start to be seen within a few days but with maximum results at 2 weeks. After 2 weeks if you are still unhappy you can then go back to your practitioner for an assessment.</p><p>At Star Cosmetic Medicine we do a 2 week follow/touch up complimentary if the patient isn’t satisfied. The wrinkle injections will work differently on everyone. Some patients find the product to last longer then others.</p><p>There is no limit on how long you can keep having botox. :). (Mariusz Gajewski, MBBS, Sydney Physician)</p><h3>When will I notice the results of Botox?</h3><p>In my opinion, patients start seeing the effect as early as 3 days and for the full effect it can take up to 2 weeks and usually lasts 3-4 months. (Bernard S. Salameh, MD, Bowling Green Physician)</p><p><strong>Botox takes several days to start working</strong></p><p>Botox takes several days to start working. In some patients, the effects will start to become noticeable within 2-3 days, but most patients will need 5-7 days to really see the results, with maximum results noticeable by days 7-10.</p><p>You will not begin to see results of your botox for 5-7 days. For some people it can take up to 2 weeks before the botox takes full effect. I always have my patients wait a full 2 weeks before returning to the office to determine if more botox is needed. (Marc J. Salzman, MD, FACS, Louisville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Your injector should discuss this with you prior to injection. (Matthew Richardson, MD, Frisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox effect time table</h5><p>Botox usually begins to act in about 3 days. Full effect may take up to 14 days but is usually 7-10 days. (Maurice M. Vick, Jr., MD, Baton Rouge Urologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3218" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>After every Botox procedure, I always inform my patients to wait for about 3 days or 72 hours, at the very least, for the effects to onset. It could possibly take longer though since our bodies have varying reactions to Botox.</p><p>Another approach that I do is giving a mild dose of Botox to my patients. If the effect is not very strong, we can always give more. I believe that giving a lot right on the get-go could produce a longer wait time of up to 4 months, just so the Botox would be fully absorb.</p><p>Giving more units if the initial one did not provide the needed results could be more helpful than trying to resolve it all at once. Again, typically it could take 72 hours at the least, but it could go longer depending on the absorption rate of the body or the results that the patient may want to achieve. (Robert W. Sheffield, MD, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3219" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I ask patients to wait at least 72 hrs for the results to onset. It can take a bit longer. Another strategy I often take is to give a light dose, if the results are not quite strong enough we can always add more.</p><p>If you give too much off the bat the patient will have to wait 4 months for it to resolve. There is no issue to add a few more units if you are still not where you want to be. (Benjamin Caughlin, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox Effects</b></p><p>It still may be a bit too soon to see the results of the treatment. Generally, the first changes are noted 2-3 days after the treatment. Maximal effect is achieved in the first two weeks after treatment. (Mahsa Sohrab, MD, New Haven Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox Results Timing</em></p><p>The drug starts to kick in after 2-3 days, but the full effect may take 2 weeks. The drug only relaxes your muscles by interfering with the action of the nerve that innervates that muscle. It doesn’t make the skin “pull back” in the other direction.</p><p>If it looks like an “11” at rest, it will look like an “11” after Botox. (Bruce Saal, MD, Los Gatos Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>You may notice the results of Botox within 3-4 days; however, the full results can be seen in 2 weeks. Try to resist the urge to add more Botox until you wait out the first 2 weeks. (Ava Shamban, MD, Santa Monica Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox effects will generally start to be seen anywhere between 3 and 7 days following injection, with full effects appearing after two weeks. (Jordan Fabrikant, DO, San Diego Dermatologist)</p><h3>Botox generally begins to work within 3-7 days following injection.</h3><p>Botox generally begins to work within 3-7 days following injection, with full results apparent at two weeks. Be patient, and you should begin to see results soon. If after two weeks you are still unhappy with the amount of correction, visit your injector again for a touch-up, as you may need a few more units. (Kory Kitagawa, MD, Honolulu Dermatologist)</p><p>Botox will take affect in 7-10 days. Sometimes a little sooner sometimes a little later. (Brian Arslanian, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>How long to see Botox work</em></p><p>It can take up to 7-14 days to see the full effect of botox. The different brands Botox cosmetic, Dysport, and Xeomin have different rates of onset. With all of them most of my patient see some response at 5 days which peaks at 14 days from injection.</p><p>Most people do not see any response in 2 days. (Jean Keamy, MD, Westborough Ophthalmologist)</p><p><em>Botox result timing</em></p><p>Botox may take 2 to 4 days to start seeing in effect and then a full week and sometimes almost 2 weeks to get the final effect. If you’re wanting something a little bit faster acting, and you may want to consider Dysport.</p><p>I have seen this start to take effect in as soon as one day but still tell my patients that it may take a full week to take full effect. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Time to full effect of Botox</i></p><p>Typically the full results of Botox injections are appreciated at 5-7 days. Each patient is a bit different in their response. Prior to this you may start to notice subtle weakness but not the full effect of treatment. (Rachel Streu, MD, FACS, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3217" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-583e2d5637c177739fe6a08f60c19730">

</div><p>I tell my patients to expect no change in their wrinkles for at least 2-3 days. At two weeks, the Botox is fully on-board, and one should see excellent results. (Clyde Mathison, MD, Knoxville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>You should wait about 2 weeks. At that time you can see your injector again for an evaluation of your results. (Michael Constantin Gartner, DO, Paramus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It is very common for the Botox to take 7 to 10 days to start working. Sometimes it works within 2 days. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox Can Take 2-3 Days To Work</em></p><p>It’s important to realize that it takes time for botox to work. In the vast majority of patients it takes 2 to 3 days to see a response to this type of treatment. This response becomes progressively stronger over the course of 5 to 7 days following injection.</p><p>Under these circumstances, it’s not unusual for vertical frown lines to remain unchanged for several days following the injection of botox. Botox is effective for treating dynamic frown lines which are related to muscle contractivity.</p><p>In cases where furrows are deep, botox may not totally correct the problem and treatment may need to be augmented with juvederm. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>2-10 days before BOTOX works</h4><p>Highly variable, but it depends on YOU and the area injected. In some patients it takes less than 48 hours, whilst in others upto 10 days, and maximal at 14 days. It also depends on the area it is injected in.
