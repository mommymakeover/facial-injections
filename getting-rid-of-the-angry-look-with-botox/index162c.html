<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The angry look between your eyes can be caused by wrinkling or strong contractions of the medial corrugators and also deep furrows of the glabella area. Botox can be used to treat the wrinkling or strong muscular pull and dermal fillers can be used to treat the deep furrows.</p><p>In extreme cases a browlift may be necessary. (Thomas Guillot, MD, Baton Rouge Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox is perfect to get rid of that “angry look”</h5><p>The “angry look” on your face is from the glabella muscles on your forehead controlling those lines of expression. Botox would need to be re-injected every four to six months depending on the depth of the wrinkles.</p><p>The area around the eyes can be injected as well. It takes just a few minutes and you could come during your lunch break or right before work to have it done! Juvederm and Restylane can be used if there are deeper furrows that need attention in that area as well.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2688" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Be certain to find an experienced injector for your treatment. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p>When we are deep in thought or angry, the corrugator muscles contract between the brows, creating a deep line or lines sometimes called the “11’s”.</p><p>After repeated contracture of this muscle, the “11’s” can become pronounced lines, even at rest.</p><p>Botox works by relaxing these muscles. With deeper lines, consistent use of Botox, sometimes in combination with filler may be required to create a smoother contour and improvement of the “angry look”. (Anil R. Shah, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox Effect</strong></p><p>The benefit of Botox would be softening those furrows and reducing the ability to keep frowning or furrowing. Sometimes patients do this without being aware of it and using Botox may help break you of the habit so that the lines do not deepen and become more permanent.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2689" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Also, some patients do notice a longer effect than 3-4 months, especially with the earlier treatments. (Mahsa Sohrab, MD, New Haven Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is a truly excellent option for glabellar frown lines. If you continue to receive Botox injections on a regular basis (before the muscle function returns completely) you may notice significant improvements in wrinkles in those areas and probably the use of smaller doses over time as the muscles you are treating atrophy.</p><p>This, in addition to excellent skin care regimens, often creates dramatic improvement in frown lines. (Rachel Streu, MD, FACS, Portland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox is one of the best things around for eliminating finelines and wrinkles such as crow’s feet. Rather than “plumping” with Juvederm or fat, Botox blocks the impulses that nerves send to muscles,essentially paralyzing the muscles and diminishing their ability to tense.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2690" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a67005cac22d88860b8bc554cc6dd331">

</div><p>Using a very fine needle, the surgeon injects Botox in small doses where thefacial muscles are most active–between the eyebrow and at the sides of theeyes, or beside the mouth.</p><p>After receiving treatment, you’re forbidden to liedown for several hours, because the medicine can absorb unevenly.</p><p>It takes oneto three days to see the effects, and the treated area will continue to improvefor up to two weeks. That’s when I schedule my patients to return, to see if atouch-up is needed. (Michelle Copeland, MD, DMD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox & filler smooth frown lines</i></p><p>Even though you may not feel you have the time, I would recommend botox to keep your muscles from deepening the furrow. The first appointment usually takes 15 minutes, since your injector will want to explain the effect and side effects to you.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2691" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>If you get a good dose, you will return about every four months. These repeat appointments can be very quick – even as quick as five minutes. If the furrow is very deep, you may also want to consider filler, which will soften the indentation.</p><p>Fillers do take a bit longer to inject than botox, but in this area, they can last for many months. If you keep the area motion-free with regular botox, your filler may even last more than a year. (Melissa Chiang, MD, FAAD, Houston Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Corrugator myotomy as alternative for Botox</h4><p>A corrugator myotomy/myectomy procedure may be an alternative to Botox treatment.</p><p>Unless you are planning to have a concurrent brow lift procedure (where the corrugator is approached from the hairline), the most common approach is going through the upper eyelid crease.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2692" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The underlying muscles that cause your frown lines include the paired corrugators and the procerus that sits in between them. Cutting the muscle and resecting (removing) a short segment will significantly weaken the muscle movement and, thus, your ability to frown.</p><p>One of the main risks of the procedure is numbness that can develop temporarily or permanently above the brow region as a result of injury to the sensory nerve traversing the area. Another possibility that should be explained in advance is the chance of scar forming across the resected muscle.</p><p>In some cases, this effectively bridges the muscle and allows movement (and frown lines) to return. It would be worth the effort to research local doctors thoroughly to find the few that perform this not so common procedure. (John M. Hilinski, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2693" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-34995e66c422e6d315276f7e9f6196f4">

</div><h5>Botox for frown lines</h5><p>Botox is a purified protein used to address wrinkles associated with facial expression. The pivotal studies demonstrated that when 20 units of Botox is used to address the vertical lines seen between the brows when one frowns peak effects are seen at 14 days and most people enjoy their results for 3-4 months.</p><p>Typically 5 injection points are made in a “V” shaped pattern between the brows. The treatment itself is very fast. In our office it takes longer to validate our patients’ parking than it takes for the actual treatment.</p><p>Most people find it a worthwhile investment of a few minutes to enjoy such results for 3-4 months. We offer weekend appointments for our patients who are unable to visit us during the week. Please consult with a doctor for specific recommendations.

</div><p>Non surgical options to get rid of the angry look on the face are BOTOX and DERMAL FILLERS, skin care, micro dermabrasion, peeling, needling and platelet rich plasma (PRP).</p><p>Surgically, if you are having upper eyelid surgery, you can have the muscles cut and weakened by a prcedure called transpalpebral corrugator resection. (Naveen Somia, MBBS, PhD, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox for angry look. Alternatives</em></p><p>Botox and Dysport are among the most common ways to soft the frown look between the brows. You can also consider the use of dermal fillers such as Restylane Silk which can directly soften the frown lines when you are not making any facial expression.</p><p>Alone, a dermal filler will not prevent you from frowning, however, it will soften the degree of active frowning, or the degree of static frown lines. I would definitely go to someone who has a lot of experience in this region and understands to risks in this area. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2695" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h3>How to get rid of the angry look on my face</h3><p>The angry look on the forehead is caused from significant contraction of the corrugator muscles between the eyebrows. Botox is an excellent temporary treatment for this condition. When patients are tired of Botox injections, and want more of a permanent effect, surgical softening of the corrugator muscle is performed with a brow lift.</p><p>In addition to softening the corrugator muscle, fascia grafts are inserted between the dermis and the muscle to prevent further wrinkles. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>A BOTOX SERIES PLUS A FILLER WORKS WELL FOR SIGNIFICANTLY PROLONGING THE AESTHETIC BENEFITS</h3><p>Neuromodulators, (substances that work on muscles, such as Botox, Dysport, and Xeomen) diminish overactivity of the muscles of facial expression. Treating the scowl (frown, angry) lines between the eyes was in fact the first approved indication for the use of Botox.</p><p>In general, the results of this kind of treatment last between four and six months. (I personally find that Dysport lasts closer to six months. However, it has been shown that if treatments with neuromodulators are given at a fixed four month interval (regardless of whether there is a recurrence of the wrinkling or not), after about five treatment sessions, the desired results may last far longer than the usual period.</p><p>Another method for prolonging the results is to combine the use of fillers, such as Juvederm Ultra XC or Restylane L, with the use of a neuromodulators. A combined treatment may last as much as a year.</p><p>Finally, considering that most of us visit our dentists once a year and our dental hygienists for a twice or three times yearly cleaning, coming for an “angry line” treatment once or twice yearly is not such an overburdensome routine. (Nelson Lee Novick, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox is Best</b></p><p>There really aren’t any good alternatives to Botox or Dysport for treating the furrows between the brows. A dermal filler can be used to fill the lines, however as long as you are still frowning, the lines will still show and continue to get deeper.</p><p>The benefit of Botox or Dysport is that they block muscle action temporarily to keep you from frowning and further deepening those lines.
