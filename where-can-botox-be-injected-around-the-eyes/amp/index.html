<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Botox injections are best used for treating crows feet to reduce the amount of contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle. As injections start to come from the crows feet medially, it important not to over do the injections directly underneath the eyelid.</p><p>2-3 units is as all that its required to soften the expression in that location but it have to be very careful about not paralyzing that muscle too much for fear of changing the shape of the eye temporarily. (William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox can be injected and is effective for fine lines around the eyes (crows feet). The amount of botox you will need depends on the depth and length of these lines. See your dermatologist for a consultation. (Gary Goldenberg, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><p>Botox injections under the eye represents advanced technique that should only be performed by very experienced injectors given that lower eyelid area is very delicate.</p><p>When done properly this procedure can produce very visible, and rapid results.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1802" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In some patients Botox injections might not be sufficient and other procedures including fractional laser resurfacing and Ulthera might be more appropriate. (Andrei Metelitsa, MD, FRCPC, FAAD, Calgary Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox for the under-eye-crinkles</h5><p>Botox can be safely used under the eye in small doses. It is a tricky area however, so many physicians may be reluctant to treat that area, especially without having an already developed relationship.</p><p>It is best to treat the rest of the eye area along with this area for optimal results. (Quenby Erickson, DO, FAAD, FACMS, Chicago Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox treatment around the eyes</em></p><p>Botox works by weakening the facial muscles of expression. When a specific muscle causes a wrinkle than treating that muscle will make that wrinkle dissipate. Your doctor should be able to tell if the smiling creases in your lower lids are caused by orbicularis muscle or by larger muscles of the face.</p><p>Depending on your anatomy treating lower lids with Botox can work quite nicely. As with any procedure, your doctor’s experience, talent and judgment is quite important to get the best possible outcome. (Boris M. Ackerman, MD, Newport Beach Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox under the eye</strong></p><p>Botox CAN be injected into the lower eyelid muscles in select patients, but this is an advanced technique that should only be performed by an expert injector. This also has the potential to cause problems, such as bruising, worsening of lower eyelid puffiness, or weakening an eyelid that may need tightening, which could cause problems with tearing, dryness, or eye exposure.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1803" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In some patients, eyelid surgery, laser resurfacing, or a chemical peel may be more appropriate. Needless to say, I always recommend using an expert physician injector who specializes in facial aesthetics for Botox injections to the lower eyelid area. (Matthew Richardson, MD, Frisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>This is generally not considered safe. Eye closure is an under appreciated extremely important function and altering it can be dangerous. (Bryan Correa, MD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox works well under the eyes</h4><p>Botox works very well under the eyes. Ophthalmologists were the first to use Botox in this area to treat a medical condition (blepharospasm). By injecting a small amount of Botox into the Orbicularis Muscle (which is in the eyelid), the muscle is relaxed and the area becomes smoother.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1804" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>This is particularly useful prior to laser skin resurfacing (Fraxel) by preventing eyelid movement during the healing phase. Be sure your doctor (oculoplastic surgeon) is experienced in this technique to avoid complications. (James R. Gordon, MD, FACS, FAAO, New York Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Crepey lower eyelid skin</strong></p><p>Crepey skin under the eyelids is often multi-factorial: overactivity of the underlying muscle, aging of the thin overlying skin, and as you mentioned upward movement of the underlying cheeks can all contribute. Botox can help when injected properly, but when injected improperly can make your situation much worse.</p><p>Botox under the eye targets the underlying muscle that can be over active. That circumferential muscle is very delicate and has three specific anatomic parts that are very close together, so only a true expert should attempt to inject in this area, as the difference between cosmetic improvement and not being able to close your eye well is literally millimeters apart.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1805" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Botox however may not be your best answer depending on what your biggest underlying problem is. For the excess, aged skin that has lost its elasticity, a laser treatment or chemical peel may be a better option.</p><p>If your issue is more related to volume loss or redistribution in your lower lids, filler or even blepharoplasty may be your best option. Again, these need to be done in the right hands. To guarantee you’re receiving the highest level of care, seek out a dermatologic surgeon, oculoplastic surgeon, facial plastic surgeon or plastic surgeon who is board certified and fellowship trained in one of these “core four” cosmetic specialties. (Cameron Chesnut, MD, FAAD, FACMS, Spokane Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox may not be your best option for the face. Injectable Filler, such as Redensity II or Restylane Fine lines may be able to help the problem. Another non-surgical option would be an under eye laser treatment.</p><p>The longest lasting option available would likely be an under eye- lower eye blepharoplasty. (Cory Torgerson, MD, PhD, FRCSC, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>No Under Eye Botox</h5><p>Botox is not indicated for under the eyes. In 2002 Botox became the first product FDA approved for moderate to severe frown lines. In 2013 Botox received its approval for moderate to severe crow’s feet. (David L. Robbins, MD, FACS, West Des Moines Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Under Eye Area & Botox</strong></p><p>It is possible to inject this area (known as the inferior orbicularis oculi) with a neuromodulator like Botox or Dysport. When just the lateral portion of this muscle is treated (the crow’s feet) patients will sometimes be able to recognize the horizontal lines under the eyes more so due to the fact that the sides of the eyes are now so much smoother.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1807" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>A very small amount is injected to help correct this problem, however, keep in mind that it is very difficult to completely remove these lines. (Supriya Tomar, MD, West Palm Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Can Botox be Used Under the Eye?</h4><p>It’s always best to refer to the professional recommendations of the doctors actually looking at you, but what is great, you can always get a second/third/fourth opinion with alternate consultations elsewhere. Some may be more comfortable injecting areas where some are not.</p><p>If you are seeking out treatment for Botox under the eye, this treatment is generally referred to as “jelly roll” and can be done if you are a good candidate. (Edward Stokes, MD, West Hollywood Physician)</p><h5>Botox Eyes Safety</h5><p>A small amount, close to the lash line, about 2 units, works well to relax the under eye muscles, but it works best when the nose and the eyes are also done at the same time.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1808" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Side effects tend to be minimal, except that bruising is common around the eye. The effect lasts as long as the rest of the Botox does. (Bruce Saal, MD, Los Gatos Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Off label use, but it can be effective</h3><p>While this is “off label” use of Botox, it can have an effect for some patients. A very small amount is placed below the eyes and can help smooth the area.</p><p>Sometimes, combining this technique with facial fillers in that region, as well, can have the best smoothing effect. (Ross Blagg, MD, Austin Physician)</p><p>After examining a patients lower lid and doing the snap-back test to assess the lid laxity, if normal, Botox can be injected under the eye and I do it all of the time. You only need about one unit and my patients love the result.</p><p>Once they have received it under the eye, they always make sure I inject it there again when they return for their maintenance visits. The result is good when injected by an experienced physician who is comfortable with this technique. (E. John Serrao, MD, Orlando OB-GYN)</p><h5>Botox Treatment for Eye Area</h5><p>It is possible to improve a crinkled look under your eye with Botox but it is not always effective for everyone. Generally, Botox is used to treat the Glabella (between the brows), forehead and crow’s feet.</p><p></p>

</div>However, expert injectors are capable of utilizing Botox to treat other areas of the face such as under the eye for a rejuvenated appearance. (Scott Chapin, MD, FACS, Philadelphia Plastic Surgeon)
<p><i>Crinkles under the eyes</i></p><p>Superficial Botox 1-2 units under each eye is a wonderful treatment to relax the lower eye lid roll. So far, 100% of my patients like the effect and have continued it! It’s a great little technique. (LeRoy Yates, MD, FACOG, Davenport OB-GYN)</p><p>Only if you have suitable skin tone. This is called a snap test and determines the elasticity of your skin. Ideally BOTOX can be used if you have bags due to strong muscles (obicularis muscles), placing one or two units of botox in this area can decrease the muscle tone, and hence decrease the bags.</p><p>If you have poor skin tone, Botox in this area may worsen your condition. The injection is very safe, and takes only 2 seconds to do, with the injection site just 2 mm from your eyelid margin.</p><p>A good Botox injector can easily and safely achieve this. The level of Botox placed is just under your skin to create a tiny bleb that will disappear over 30 min with some ice. If performed correctly, you will look better within days, with less noticeable eye bags. (Davin Lim, MBBS, FACD, Brisbane Dermatologist)</p><p>The crinkles come when your cheeks push up (when you are smiling usually). The only way to stop this movement would be to stop you from smiling (not very practical).</p><p>Resurfacing the area might help the crinkles, and if Fraxel did not work, then fractional CO2 is much more effective at treating wrinkles and we get especially good results around and under the eyes. The only time I use Botox under the eye is to “round” or open the eye a bit.</p><p>Very small amounts of Botox can achieve this effect which some people find desirable. (Todd Minars, MD, Miami Dermatologist)</p></div>
