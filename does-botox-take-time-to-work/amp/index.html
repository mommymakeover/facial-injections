<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The effects of Botox can usually be seen by 5-7 days after injection, although full effects may take up to 2 weeks. If after 2 weeks, you feel that you haven’t received the full benefit, talk to your doctor as you may simply need more to achieve the desired effect.</p><p>The number of times that you can receive Botox is unlimited, but your face will continue to age and eventually your best choice may be surgery. (John Zavell, MD, FACS, Toledo Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox time to work</h5><p>Botox takes 1 week to work. For some patients it works in 3-4 days some takes 7-8 days. It lasts for at 3 months. (Avron Lipschitz, MD, Stuart Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox should last about four months. I have been injecting Botox for over 15 years, and I have some long term patients who now need Botox about every six months.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1049" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-370eebd5cd2867caf195e5e39bee18dd">

</div><p>I think with their continued use of Botox, their muscles have been permanently weakened. (Stephan Finical, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>How long before botox works after injection?</em></p><p>Botox, Dysport and Xeomin all take approximately 5-7 days for full effect. If you have been receiving one of these injectables regularly it can be faster, some patients report as fast as 2 days. The response to each medication is variable, certain patients feel that one of the medications works faster than others in them.</p><p>I tell my patients that the toxin inhibits for about 3-4 months, but I have had a few patients that it lasts only 2 months, and a lucky few that can go 5 months between injections, so it does vary slightly.</p><p>Botox has been available in the U. S. for cosmetic purposes for over 10 years and I have patients that have been receiving it every 3-4 months for almost that entire time without problems.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1050" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-12f01ac6ec38eb6dbc10b992a0794d3b">

</div><p>At this time there is no restriction on how long you can continue to receive Botox, Dysport, or Xeomin injections. (Jennifer Janiga, MD, Reno Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox Is Fast and Effective</h4><p>The majority of my patients report they notice a difference 3-4 days after their Botox treatment; however, in some patients it may take a week post Botox treatment to notice results.</p><p>Depending on how severe the patients lines are will help depict when “full benefits” are achieved.</p><p>For deep lines, that are visible even when the face is relaxed, it may take multiple treatments to reduce their appearance. There are no limitations on the amount of times a patient can receive Botox.</p><p>As long as your are healthy, not pregnant or breast feeding, etc. continuing to receive Botox is fine.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1056" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><p>Also, for many people Botox treatments are scheduled in 4 month increments; however, for some it could be more frequent or less frequent than this.</p><p>Everyone is different. Some patients have stronger facial muscles than others, some metabolize Botox faster than others, and some use more facial movement during expression than others.</p><p>This is personalized and you and your injector should discuss the proper time frame for your individually. (Peter J. Capizzi, MD, Charlotte Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox usually starts working after a couple of days but does not reach its full result for nearly two weeks. It typically lasts for 3-4 months.</p><p>Each person is a little different. It is possible that you can start to lengthen the time from one treatment to another after you have used it for a while.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1052" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Make sure that you go to a qualified surgeon’s office and receive real Botox. Your ideal result should be a refreshed look but not overdone. (Rodger Shortt, FRCSC, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox Results, benefit, result, etc.</h5><p>It varies, typically it takes between 3-7 days to start working and up to 2 weeks to achieve it’s maximum effect. That is of course if your initial treatment was an adequate dose. On average, people can get Botox every 3 months.</p><p>When the movement it back then it’s time to be retreated. There is no limit to how long a person can keep getting Botox as well. (Brian C. Reuben, MD, Salt Lake City Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Three to ten days</i></p><p>Usually you will begin to see results with in 3 days and full effect at 10 days. If any corrections need to be done 14 days should be the right time to do this. (Tal T. Roudner, MD, FACS, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1053" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Many of my patient’s notice the full effect of their Botox between 5-7 days. We recommend that you keep up your treatment and reevaluate every 3 months to see if you need a touch up. I have many, many patients who have been using Botox for years and the only time they are interested in a change is when a new product comes out on the market that will give them the same result.</p><p>You can always take advantage of many price comparisons when new products come available that can give you the same results or stay with your current regimen, there is no time limit in getting Botox over the years.

</div><p>You may see some effects of BOTOX 3-4 days after the date of injection. It generally takes 14 days to see the full effect of BOTOX. It lasts 3-4 months, although I have had patients in whom it lasted longer than this.</p><p>I am not aware of any limit to the number of times one can receive BOTOX over a lifetime. (Adam Schaffner, MD, FACS, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox acts quickly and lasts for about 3 months</em></p><p>Botox usually starts working in several days but can take up to 2 weeks for the full effect. The duration of the treatment varies from person to person, but on average is 3 months. Botox treatment can be repeated when needed for as long as needed.</p><p>There does not appear to be any risk to repeated treatments over years of time. (Elizabeth Slass Lee, MD, Bay Area Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1055" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The length of time that it takes for Botox to take full effect differs from person to person. Some patients see results within 3-4 days and other patients it may take up to 10-14 days to see results.</p><p>The results typically last 3-4 months. (Robert Heck, MD, FACS, Columbus Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox results usually take 3-7 days to be fully seen</b></p><p>As stated, the effects of Botox treatments usually take 3-7 days to be seen. However, I do have patients that tell me that they have seen results within the first couple days. I tell my patients (especially my first time patients) that it may take up to 10 days to see the full effects. (Steven E. Rasmussen, MD, FAAD, Austin Dermatologist)</p><p><strong>3 days or longer to see the initial effect of Botox</strong></p><p>I routinely tell patients not to expect any change after Botox for at least 3 to 5 days. It often looks it’s best at 2 weeks and eventually wears off at 4 to 5 months at which time the procedure can be repeated. (Darrick E. Antell, MD, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Typically, patients see immediate results between 4-7 days. There are patients who see and feel a difference within 24 hours. Deeper lines may not be erased with the first session and will likely continue to fade with repeated injections over time. (Anil R. Shah, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox will start working in 3-4 days. It can last anywhere from 3-9 months. There is no residual effect from Botox. You can get Botox for a long time without lasting effect. (Sugene Kim, MD, FACS, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It can take up to 10 days to see the final results of Botox, however you should start to see these results within 3-5 days. Dysport works faster and results begin to be seen in a day.</p><p>Again, you should wait 10 days to see your final results. There is no limit to the amount of times that you can use these products. (Jacob D. Steiger, MD, Boca Raton Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Results in 3-7 days</em></p><p>Some patients report results with Botox immediately or in one day but that is normally due to some minor swelling. True results appear gradually over 3-7 days and the full benefit is for most people within that range, but results vary from patient to patient.</p><p>I usually counsel my patients in the use of Botox in the first year for it to be used every 3-4 months so that the muscles can get weaker. If you stick to this regimen then the results can last longer with each treatment and less units are often used.</p><p>The muscles get weaker with time and prevent wrinkles from forming. I have had patients go 9 months between injections and have had Botox for 10+ years. Botox is safe for long-term use. (Kristina Tansavatdi, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
