<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Botox for the forehead wrinkles will average around $100-$500 a treatment. Foreheads are one of the more difficult areas to treat.</p><p>Under treat and you still have wrinkles, over treat and your brows drop. You can also get a droopy eyelid from the forehead injection. (Kurtis Martin, MD, Cincinnati Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox price for Forehead Wrinkles</i></p><p>This varies depending on each facility, as some charge by the unit while others charge a set amount by the area.</p><p>The typical cost per unit is $10-15, but there is regional variation, ie. likely more expensive in certain cities.</p><p>The amount of units is specific to each person and what they want to achieve. I think anywhere from 8-20 units is common depending on if you want absolutely no wrinkles VS mild movement. (Sapna A. Patel, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3180" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><h4>Botox Price for forehead</h4><p>Botox for $10 unit is quite low and not likely to be offered at that price by a board-certified specialist who is well trained in neurotoxin injection technique. My office charges by the area rather than by the unit.</p><p>I prefer to be rather conservative with my treatments in the forehead area to give the desired result but preserve animation and prevent the “static” appearance of an over injected forehead. We charge $240 for the forehead and the same amount for the glabellar region if there is significant hyperactivity of the corrugator muscles.</p><p>That being said, all individuals are different and some may need slightly more or less product depending on their muscle bulk, hyperactivity and previous treatments. (Jacque P. LeBeau, MD, Pensacola Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3181" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h4>Botox price for forehead wrinkles</h4><p>Botox pricing will depend on the injector, geographic market, and the particular patient. Some injectors price Botox by the area while others price it by the unit. If your Botox is being priced by the unit, then it comes down to how many units you will require to achieve the result you are looking for.</p><p>Most patients will require 10-20 units to treat the horizontal forehead wrinkles, with an additional 20 or so units required to treat the wrinkles between the eyebrows in the glabella area. Also, $10/unit is quite low in most markets, so be sure that you are seeing a skilled physician injector. (Matthew Richardson, MD, Frisco Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>How much does it cost for forehead wrinkles?</b></p><p>Price charging per unit differs from clinic to clinic. Some charge anywhere between $9 to 13 per unit. However, do expect to pay more since there is no standardized number of Botox units for a specific area.</p><p>This means that treatments may be customized depending on what goals you want to achieve. In this case, your treatment plan may cost anywhere from $100 to $550. On the other hand, there are also those who do not charge by the “unit”. Instead, they charge by the “area” that needs Botox injection.</p><p>The variety in prices is loosely due to different factors such as:</p><ul>
<li>Amount of Botox that will be used in the desired area</li>
<li>The expertise and skill of the Botox injector</li>
<li>The clinic and location where you will have the injection done</li>
</ul><p>As for Botox on the forehead, it may generally need 8 to 12 units, which would roughly cost $72 to $156 depending on the region. (Robert W. Sheffield, MD, Santa Barbara Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3183" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><em>Price of botox for the forehead</em></p><p>Different physicians will price procedures like botulinum toxin differently — some by area, some by unit. But what you are ‘buying’ isn’t the botox or xeomin or dysport, it is the eyes and hands of the physician.</p><p>Have a consult with a board certified core-cosmetic physician (dermatologist, plastic surgeon, facial plastic surgeon or oculoplastic surgeon) and discuss your needs and the best way to get to them. She can explain to you whether toxin is appropriate for your forehead and, if so, how much is needed.</p><p>She will also let you know if toxin alone will get the results you want or if you also require filler, resurfacing or another procedure. Remember, getting botulinum toxin isn’t like buying a particular dress or shoes.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3184" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>You wont get the same results everywhere by everyone and shouldn’t choose based on price. . (Heidi A. Waldorf, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h5>Botox Price for Forehead Wrinkles?</h5><p>Most clients require anywhere from 20 to 50 units for treatment-depends on severity as well as total areas injected. Average price is for 30 units and is $420. We charge strictly by the unit and is $14 per unit. (Hardik Soni, MD (not currently practicing), Summit Emergency Medicine Physician)</p><h3>Botox Pricing</h3><p>The price for a Botox treatment is variable and usually depends on the number of Botox Units used. The number of Units used is influenced by the desired effect, the amount of current animation, and the strength of the muscles.</p><p>For new patients, however, the exact dosing is often discovered through a trial and error process. See link below. Some rough guidelines are:</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3185" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Forehead: 16 units<br>
Crowfeet (around eyes): 8 units per side<br>
Glabella (between eyes): 18 units</p><p>The price in my practice is $12 a Unit, however, new patients receive a discount on their first session.</p><p>A detailed examination will help delineate your treatment options. Consultation with a surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery would be the next best step. (David Tauber, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The price will range from $10-15 a unit. In my practice we charge $12.50/unit. I personally do all of my own injections. I do urge you to check the credentials and experience of your injector prior to your first Botox session. (Robert Najera, MD, Frisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Fore head Botox Cost</em></p><p>I would normally start with 10 units of Botox or 30 units of Dysport in the forehead region. I would consider putting more if there is still movement and no heaviness in the brows. Most places charge by the unit, so you can multiply the cost per unit.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3186" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>I will mention, however, that results do vary using the same number of units depending on the injector skill and those with more experience and skill usually charge more. (Young R. Cho, MD, PhD, Houston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox can be charged for by the unit or by the area. Typically one area will need 20-30 units injected, so use the price you are quoted to calculate the total dollar amount depending on your particular needs. (Cory Torgerson, MD, PhD, FRCSC, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox price for forehead wrinkles</b></p><p>There are 2 groups of muscles on the Forehead that are typically injected with Botox, so it depends on which group of muscles you want to inject. The corrugator muscle complex usually requires 20 units, and the frontalis muscle requires 25 units.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_3187" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

(William Portuese, MD, Seattle Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Depends on the city that where you live and physician and anesthesia. For this we can not say exactly. (Jhonny Salomon, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The price of Botox varies with the location and the qualifications of the injector. In my area of Houston the Botox is 12 – 15 dollars per unit. In some areas it is as high as 20 per unit. (Thomas Guillot, MD, Baton Rouge Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox Fees</strong></p><p>The fees for Botox will vary based on your geographical area. The amount of Botox used is based on the particular area in which you are seeking improvement. Discuss with your surgeon your concerns. You should receive an exact quote prior to treatment.

</div><p>The prices for Botox depend on the area that is treated. The dosage that is used differs a lot between doctors. Some physicians use a low amount of Botox and have a lower pricing. Unfortunately there is less effect and and shorter duration of effect with less Botox… (Robert Kasten, MD, Mainz Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Thicker, stronger muscles require more units ot Botox for full effect. Larger areas require more units as well. Your anatomy dictates how many units are appropriate. In general, we treat female foreheads with 25-40 units of Botox.</p><p>10-20 units would be an undertreatment for most women, in my experience, and would likely wear off much sooner than 3-4 months. (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Every office will differ in prices. Beware that if you find a deal “to good to be true” most likely it is. Some have diluted Botox to drive the price down. I agree with the doctors on this forum that $10-$12 is typical per unit.</p><p>We charge $11.00 per unit. Each person vary’s on what they would like to achieve. Its imperative that we have a consultation prior to the actual injection session. Sometimes, when a patient comes in they end up being a candidate for a different injectable that is more what they are looking for aesthetically.
