<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h4>Five to ten days</h4><p>Typically, Botox cosmetic takes effect in 5-10 days and lasts between 2-4 months. This does vary widely as some individuals notice the effect within hours.</p><p>There does not seem to be a specific limit as to how often or how long one can receive Botox.</p><p>Some patients come in every few weeks and treat different areas on the face rotating the areas of treatment. (Janet Turkle, MD, Indianapolis Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In some cases the same day you can see but usually 3 days will be the normal to see the botox results. (Jhonny Salomon, MD, Miami Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Once injected, you can see results by the next day but final results take 10 days or so. Botox can last only 8 weeks in some to over 6 months in a few lucky patients.

</div><p>Facial muscle relaxation following Botox injection usually begins 3-5 days following the injection. Full muscle paralysis typically takes 10-14 days following injection.</p><p>If you still experience movement after two weeks, it is best to see your provider for evaluation. (Steven J. Rottman, MD, FACS, Baltimore Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It takes 4-10 days to see the full effect of Botox. You need it every 3- 4 months or so. Some patients don’t need it for 5-6 months but this is an exception. I have noticed a few ‘ non responders’ ( people who do not have any response to Botox).</p><p>This means that they have anti bodies to Botox and would require Xeomin ( the next generation toxin, which is pure and hence lower risk of being a non responder).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1059" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>There are rumours that Xeomin is due to be released in Australia in July 2014. (Naveen Somia, MBBS, PhD, FRACS, Sydney Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox Results Are Seen Within 2-3 Days of Injection</h5><p>In the vast majority of patients the results of botox are seen within 2 to 3 days of injection. In rare cases, benefits may be seen as early as 24 hours following the procedure.</p><p>The response to botox becomes progressively stronger for approximately 5 to 7 days after treatment.</p><p>At this point, most patients have an excellent clinical result and are very satisfied with the results. Botox is often repeated at 3 to 4 months month intervals. These injections can be repeated indefinitely. Long-term problems aren’t associated with the use of botox.</p><p>When botox is used for prolonged periods the muscles can fatigue. This often results in a decreased botox requirement. (Richard J. Bruneteau, MD, Omaha Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1060" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-e24e597143b25244ff1b1a78a26ec2eb">

</div><p>I have patients report a difference is 24 hours, but generally it takes 4 days to start working. You should be seeing the full effect by 7-10 days. (Jason Mussman, MD, Phoenix Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>The benefits of Botox</em></p><p>Following a Botox treatment, you can see the benefits after a week. We generally repeat it after three to four months, and there’s really no limit as to how long one can carry on with Botox. (Glynn Bolitho, PhD, MD, FACS, San Diego Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox is slower than Dysport</strong></p><p>Botox begins working within 3 to 5 days. A competitor, Dysport, begins working in 2 to 3 days.</p><p>Both products last about 3 to 4 months in most patients. You can undergo Botox as frequently as every 3 months-or as infrequently as you like.</p><p>Wrinkles can be static (visible at rest) or dynamic (visible only when squinting or frowning). The advantage of undergoing regular injections is that your static wrinkles will gradually get better and better. If you space out your injections too much, your muscles will have a chance to fully recover between treatments, and you will not tend to see the same degree of improvement in your static wrinkles.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1061" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-736b2e8538ada09cab919d1448bab1ee">

</div><p>There is no known limit to the number of Botox injections you can safely receive. (Ronald Friedman, MD, Plano Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I generally ask patients to come back in two weeks later for the “after” picture. If they need a touch up or some additional correction, we can address it then. It starts to work sooner but the maximal effect should be present by then. (Beverly Johnson, MD, Silver Spring Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>In my practice I have seen Botox last as long as 9 months however, it most commonly lasts for 4 months. There is no limit to how long one can keep getting Botox treatments. (George C. Peck, Jr, MD, West Orange Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>3-4 days for initial effects of neurotoxins such as Botox, Dysport or Xeomin to be seen The typical patient will have the greatest results beginning at two weeks and will then begin to notice the muscle function return within 3-4 months</p><p>There are no current studies to indicate a suggested limit to the amount of times a patient may be treated with a neurotoxin over their lifetime. (Jacque P. LeBeau, MD, Pensacola Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1062" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b1c50de8a8e3192d838b8a622042f321">

</div><h5>Botox: Onset and Duration of Effect</h5><p>Botox onset (i.e., when the effects become noticeable) is generally between 3 and 6 days. This varies by dose (number of units), muscle group (e.g., forehead vs. frown lines), and patient.</p><p>The treatment will wear off and the nerves endings generate new connections to the injected muscles.</p><p>This may be as soon as 3 months or as long as 6, again, depending on the above factors. (Evan Ransom, MD, FACS, Bay Area Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>You should start seeing the results of BOTOX in about 3-5 days</h4><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1063" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Results of BOTOX should be noticeable within 3 -5 days of injection, and the maximum benefit is usually noticed around 7 – 10 days after injection. By and large, BOTOX seems to be safe over follow up periods running into a few decades. (Renita (Lourdhurajan) Rajan, MD, DNB, India Dermatologist)</p><h3>Results after Botox</h3><p>One should see the full effects of Botox within one week. I have not heard or read any contraindications to receiving Botox injections for many years and one study has even posited that after seven to ten years patients may not require the frequency of injections as when they were younger. (Jonathan Berman, MD, Boca Raton Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>My patients typically see full results around day 4-5. Many of them note that they start to see changes slowly appear from day 2-4. I usually use a rule of thumb of one full week to see the complete results.</p><p>Typically, results will last from 3-4 months and can be repeated. I have patients that I have treated for over a decade. (William P. Mack, MD, PA, Tampa Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1064" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><h5>Botox results are usually noted in 3-7 days</h5><p>The start of Botox, Xeomin and Dysport results can occur as soon as 2-3 days. Most will note changes by 7 days. Botox , as well as the others, appear to work best at 30 days. While many will have a “honeymoon” affect and LOVE the results from the first injection, many note greater improvements with subsequent injections.</p><p>I have many patients who continue to enjoy the effects of Botox and have been with me for close to two decades! (Mark Berkowitz, MD, Sterling Heights Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p>The peak effect takes about 2 weeks to manifest itself. The duration of action is 3-4 months. Some patients find that after being on a routine schedule of Botox injections the effect occurs in a shorter time period and may last longer than 4 months. (Thomas Guillot, MD, Baton Rouge Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1065" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p><strong>Botox takes 3-7 days to become effective</strong></p><p>In most of my patients, Botox shows effects after 3-7 days and by 2 weeks appears to be maximally effective. It lasts from 3-6 months in most patients. There is no theoretical limit to how long you can receive Botox injections.</p><p>However, some patients eventually develop antibodies to the drug, which cause it to be less effective or not work at all. (Matheson A. Harris, MD, Salt Lake City Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Results of botox</h4><p>In general, Botox/Dysport tends to work within three to five days following injection, a week at the outside. If it isn’t working after a week then it isn’t working and you probably need a touch-up.</p><p>Botox/Dysport usually lasts three to six months. Once it degrades, it is gone and there is no residual effect. You can have Botox/Dysport for as long as you want to since there are no known long-term effects that would prevent you from doing so.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1066" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>There is also no evidence that the body builds up a tolerance to Botox/Dysport over time. (Edwin C. Pound, III, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In most patients, the effects of Botox injections is evident within 3-7 days.</p><p>You will be unable to move the group of muscles that were treated, ex. inablity to frown, but the wrinkles already established because of the previous working of these muscles that damaged the collegen in the skin, and produced a permanent crease, will be still visible. (Kris Conrad, MD, Toronto Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox results should be seen anywhere from 3-7 days. I don’t believe there is a limit for the length of time that a patient can keep receiving Botox. (David Alessi, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox results within a few days</h5><p>While the effects from Botox can be seen within a few days, it can take up to two weeks for the final result. It usually lasts for around 3 to 4 months, although many of my patients have seen improvement for longer. (Ryan Greene, MD, PhD, Fort Lauderdale Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It usually takes about 4-5 days for Botox results to show. Botox usually lasts about 4-6 months depending on the person. There’s no set limit for how long people can keep getting Botox. As long as it’s indicated for your particular anatomy, there’s no harm in getting it routinely.</p><p>Some people do develop a tolerance or resistance to Botox and need to switch to another strain of Botox. (Catherine Huang-Begovic, MD, FACS, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox usually begins working at 3-5 days post-injection.</em></p><p>Botox usually begins working approximately 3-5 days after the injection. Some considerations are how many units you receive (I usually do not recommend less than 30 units). It should last 3-4 months. (Peter Schmid, DO, FAACS, Longmont Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox results usually appear within 5-7 dyas after treatment. It will usually last 3 -4 months and I usually have patients come back at that point for further treatment. (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Seeing a Botox result</b></p><p>Botox usually will take affect within a week from the initial treatment. Maybe sooner if you are a frequent Botox user. (Vincent N. Zubowicz, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
