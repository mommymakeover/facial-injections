<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><h4>Work with your physician to determine the appropriate product</h4><p>Juvederm and Restylane are both excellent hyaluronic (HA) fillers that offer unique advantages for facial rejuvenation. Restylane is similar to Juvederm Ultra, and Perlane is similar to Juvederm Ultra Plus – both contain larger-sized hyaluronic acid particles.</p><p>A number of factors determine product selection depending on the area being treated, the degree of sagging/volume loss, depth of wrinkles, etc. An experienced injector will have a specific criteria when choosing the appropriate HA product.</p><p>Juvederm tends to attract more water and therefore, the injector must be considerate of product placement because it can cause puffiness. I would not recommend using it under the areas (tear troughs). The amount of hyaluronic acid in a dermal filler contributes to its structure and longevity.<br>

</div>Juvederm contains 35% more cross-linked hyaluronic acid than Restylane. Juvederm Ultra Plus typically lasts between 9 to 12 months while Restylane lasts 4 to 6 months or longer. Please keep in mind that the hyaluronic acid lasting effects vary from person to person depending on genetics and other physical/metabolic health factors. (Cheryl Perlis, MD, FACOG, Highland Park Physician)
<p>Both are very safe, effective, and similar in cost. They are both formulations of hyaluronic acid which a clear gel like substance that is found normally in your joint cartilage and is also an important component of normal youthful skin that diminishes with age.</p><p>In our experience Juvederm seems to last a bit longer. Restylane can be a bit more “form stable” making it a good choice for areas where millimeters count, like the tear trough. Most hyaluronic acid based fillers can be expected to last around 9-12 months.<br>

</div>It really depends on the amount and the area injected. Injections should always be performed by a skilled, experienced, board certified core aesthetic provider (Plastic Surgeon, Dermatologist) or a nurse injector working in the office of a board certified core provider.
<p>It’s a plus if the surgeon is also a member of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, a very selective organization that indicates a higher standard of aesthetic surgical training and expertise. It’s important that they listen and pick what’s right for treatment area. (Neil Fine, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>I have had them both injected in my own face and I think they last a similar amount of time. Depending on the area you want injected, I would prefer one over the other.<br>

<p><strong>Juvederm vs. Restylane</strong></p><p>Both Juvederm and Restylane are excellent products. We use a great deal of both in our office. Some patients may find that they prefer one over the other or have more longevity with one but others may notice no discernable difference whatsoever.</p><p>In our practice, we prefer to use Restylane for the tear troughs. Results from injectables are much more dependent on the injector and not the product, so when choosing begin by choosing the best provider and letting them decide, based on their knowledge, experience and expertise which product is ideal for you.

</div>There are no shortage of excellent answers. I have found that patients who have had both products injected into the lip area prefer Juvederm as it feels “smoother” to them. Some patients report similar findings in the tear trough area.
<p>In other areas my patients have noted no difference between Restylane and Juvederm which costs more per dose. (Otto Joseph Placik, MD, Chicago Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Juvederm and Restylane are both made of hyaluronic acid however the way they are formulated makes them respond a little differently. They are both excellent fillers that have a lot more common than any differences.</p><p> Both are soft, natural fillers that can achieve excellent results in many parts of the face.  They both have the safety feature of being able to be quickly dissolved in the unlikely event that you are not happy with your treatment.<br>

</div> One major difference is that Restylane is a better choice for under the eyes because some people get prolonged swelling with Juvederm in that particular area (that can happen with Restylane, too…but it is much more uncommon).
<p> In my experience both last about the same amount of time.  However there are some people who find that one last longer than the other.  In my experience there is a relatively small group of women who tend to metabolize Restylane more quickly.</p><p> Please remember that the real key to success lies not in the product, but in your cosmetic surgeons expertise. Your doctor will help you choose the right product.  It is your job to choose the right doctor. (Marc Cohen, MD, Philadelphia Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Juvederm vs Restylane</h4><p>There is not an answer to the question of whether Restylane or Juvederm is “better” for tear trought. They are both hyaluronic acid fillers approved by the FDA for cosmetic revolumization of facial structures. For someone to say that one is better than the other is like saying a hammer is better than a mallet.</p><p>They are similar, and they can both accomplish the same things from time to time, but there are definitely differences about them that make one a better tool in a certain situation. There are entire book chapters about the differences in the physical properties between these two products, but basically they are in different phases, they are different in their concentration of hyaluronic acid, they have different cross-linking, they have different viscosities, etc.<br>

</div>In properly educated and experienced hands, those subtle differences can be exploited for your benefit depending on what you’re after. For example, I prefer Restylane around the eyes because it tends to absorb a little bit less water than Juvéderm does, and in my opinion tends to get better results in the periocular area.
<p>On the other hand, I prefer to use Juvéderm in the lips for similar reasons. Find someone who knows the difference between a hammer and a mallet and how they can use them properly.(Cameron Chesnut, MD, FAAD, FACMS, Spokane Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Juvederm vs. Restylane – which is better?</b></p><p>If you ask 10 different doctors, you are likely to get 10 different answers to this one. The fact is that these products are very similar, If you look at the package insert (information from the FDA), it’s very hard to tell the difference.</p><p>Some doctors prefer one over the other because they feel different to us when we use the products. But to the patients, the difference is very small. Some doctors think that Juvederm is less likely to cause a blue hue.</p><p>But that really has to do with the experience of the injector. So find a dermatologist you trust and work with him/her. Let them choose the product that’s right for you. (Gary Goldenberg, MD, New York Dermatologist)</p><h3>Juvederm vs. Restylane!!</h3><p></p>

</div>Since both Juvederm and Restylane are hyaluronic acids it means they are found in the body already, and should not regularly cause any irritation. I personally prefer to use Restylane for more delicate areas that need a precise amount of filler, such as around the eyes.
<p>Juvederm, on the other hand, tends to cause a bit of puffiness due to local water absorption, making injecting it into the lips and cheeks a beautiful touch. They are both well used and trusted items with the proper administrator. (Yael Halaas, MD, Manhattan Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Minor differences between Juvederm and Restylane</h5><p>I find Juvederm to be a bit softer and easier to inject. I prefer Restylane for injections in the lower eyelid as the product tends to migrate less than Juvederm. I believe thay have similiar profile on longevity and bruising. (Reza Nabavian, MD, Santa Monica Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In my experience they both have similar duration and effect. There are other things that determine how long the treatments last. My suggestion would be to try both and see which one works and is better suited for you. (Vu Ho, MD, Plano Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>They both can last a couple of months and are both fda approved. (Hani Sinno, MD, Montreal Plastic Surgeon)</p><p></p>

</div>While Restylane and Juvederm are both cross linked hyaluronic acid products in our office we primarily use Juvederm instead of Restylane for two reasons: we do believe that it last a bit longer, and since we purchase more J than R we get a better deal from the manufacturer and pass those savings along to our patients. (Thomas McFadden, MD, Greenville Plastic Surgeon)
<p><i>Juverderm preference</i></p><p>Juvederm is in my opinion a better filler for NLF (nasal labial fold) because it is a larger product and I feel it is more pliable product. I also have seen in my product juvederm ulta plus and xc lasting longer than juvederm.</p><p>Each product has its pros and cons. However, my personal experience has caused me to use Juvederm much more than Restylane. (Christofer Buatti, DO, Detroit Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Depends on which doctor you see…some doctors have a preference and that probably takes precedence over the small but real differences in the products…don’t want to prod a doctor who likes one product to use the other…the only caveat is that around the eyes and in the lips more doctors seem to prefer restylane since it does not swell as much…but overall the most experienced injectors get great results with whatever product they use…and some people have a preference for one product or the other…kind of a Coke or Pepsi issue…add ice and a piece of lemon and its almost impossible to distinguish between the two… (Ken Landow, MD, Las Vegas Dermatologist)</p></div>
