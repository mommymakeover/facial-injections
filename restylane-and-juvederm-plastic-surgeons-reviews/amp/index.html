</div><p>I concur with the observation that juvederm tends to become a bit more hydrated and thus may ultimately give more volume per syringe. Depending on the area to be treated this may be an advantage or a disadvantage.</p><p>It is best to have an experienced injector that understands the science and nuances associated with these products. (Julian W. Dixon, MD, Chicago Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Both Restylane and Juvederm are excellent fillers. I like to use both of them. The best thing to do is select a very experienced injector and trust their opinion of whch product should be used. (Esta Kronberg, MD, Houston Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>Both are FDA hyaluronic acid dermal fillers. Depending on where you want areas you are looking to get filler put in, your board certified specialist may prefer one over the other. The most important thing is finding a qualified injector who can best help you achieve the results you are looking for. (Kimberly Lee, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Deciding between Restylane and Juvederm</i></p><p>While we use and advocate for both products, we make the decision about which one to use based on a number of factors:</p><p>Area being injected. We do have preferences based on the area of the face.<br>
Amount of product needed. Because Juvederm comes in a 8cc syringe, we often reach for Restylane when we need that little bit of extra volume (1cc). With price sensitive patients, we also use products based on whether a patient is looking for a rebate and the manufacturer (distributor) is currently offering one. (Harold J. Kaplan, MD, Los Angeles Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Marketing companies will have you believe that one is better than the other, but they are comparable to each other. (Kimberly A. Henry, MD, Greenbrae Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2110" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p><b>Choose a practice that has both restylane and juvederm</b></p><p>We use both in our practice and each has its advantages and disadvantages: To give you an example</p><p>1. We only use Restylane in the tear trough area. Juvederm is very hydrophilic (absorbs water) and it can swell and give the lower eyelids, or tear trough area a bluish tinge.</p><p>It is best to find a provider who seems astute, artsy, and an able injector. (Pramit Malhotra, MD, Ann Arbor Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Juvederm is a cross linked hyaluronic acid, it is more dense and thicker with a higher molecular weight so it lasts longer than Restylane.</p><p>In deciding on any dermal filler, some things to consider is to take into account the cost, the duration of how long it will last, the medications to avoid (i.e. aspirin, blood thinners, fish oil), and allergic tendencies to similar medications. Juvederm causes less puffiness, has a smoother appearance, contains 35% more hyaluronic acid than Restylane, therefore, Juvederm costs a little more than Restylane. (Florencia Guzman, MD, West Chester Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2111" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><h5>Juvederm vs. Restylane</h5><p>Currently, there are five FDA approved Juvederm products from Allergan and five FDA approved Restylane products from Galderma available in the US.</p><p>Both companies have more products in the pipeline that will become available in the future and both companies are striving for all the market quite aggressively.</p><p>Most seasoned aesthetic injectors agree that you do not need to stock all ten products to produce outstanding results for patients.</p><p>A seasoned injector will choose wisely and deliberately to carry only certain products and eliminate others based on their preferences. In my practice, I have chosen to work with Allergan Juvederm products because in my hands they produce less post injection swelling and bruising.</p><p>Juvederm products are known to last longer. The products vary from the consistency of Jell-O that has not gone into the refrigerator yet to Jell-O with extra gelatin that feels like a gummy bear. Thus by limiting the choices to a manageable five instead of ten products, I choose products based on the patient’s desired results and the part of the face being injected and the right product consistency for the job instead of choosing products based on aggressive marketing tactics of filler companies and in office inventory issues.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2112" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>When you choose to go to a practice that carries EVERYTHING and has a certain product on SALE, what you end up getting may be based on what they currently need to sell, not what is best for you.</p><p>I always refer back to the patient’s medical records and inject the same product in areas that need reinjections to stay consistent from injection to injection. As a perfectionist and a purist, I like to refer back to my patient’s medical records and know exactly that there was an aesthetic reason for why I injected a certain product in a particular part of the face that has nothing to do with INVENTORY or SALE reasons.</p><p>So in my practice, the burden of choice of the product is not on the patient. As their expert injector, I choose the products based on desired results.

</div><p><strong>Depends on the application</strong></p><p>Which one is better depends on where and how you are using it. A good injector is able to use the properties of each to their advantage. It’s like using different brushes and colors to paint a picture.</p><p>How long they last is important but beautiful results are more important. (Jeffrey Jumaily, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Low molecular weight products = longevity </em></p><p>In the past, hyaluronic fillers (Juvederm/Restylane) were made of 100% high molecular weight hyaluronic acid, which would often swell after injection and in clinical practice would more frequently than not have only 6-9 months of visible results.</p><p>The newer two Juvederm products (Volbella and Vollure) are comprised of 90% low molecular weight hyaluronic acid and only 10% high, so you get products that don’t tend to swell much, if at all, and last 12-18 months, far longer than the older ones.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2114" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The PA-C (Physician Assistant) I work with has injected hundreds of syringes of Volbella since the U. S. launch in late October 2016 and absolutely loves it, as do our patients. Finally a product where we can do detail-oriented “etching” of fine lines right under the skin.</p><p>It’s definitely a game changer, in my opinion. (Bart Rademaker, MD, Tampa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In experienced hand, either hyaluronic acid based products will lead to great results. Comes down to understanding each product’s physical characteristics and its behavior once it has been injected. The science behind fillers are evolving every day and newer subclass products are being introduced to address everyone’s need.</p><p>Juvederm, for example, have 4 subclasses in USA (more in Canada & Europe)! I recommend to seek an experienced clinician discuss your goals and decide on what is best product for your goals. It’s the artist not the paint. (John S. Won, MD, Raleigh-Durham Physician)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2115" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Both are good products. Restylane is better for the hollows under the eyes. Juvederm can result in a bluish discoloration there. Voluma lasts longer, but honestly both do the job well. (Samer Muala, MD, Phoenix Family Physician)</p><p>I have significant experience working with Juvederm and Restylane to do lip augmentation. My preference is to use Juvederm to complete this procedure as it’s longer lasting than Restylane and less potential for swelling. (Justin Harper, MD, Columbus Physician)</p><p>Both Juvederm and Restylane are FDA approved hyaluronic acid fillers that are excellent at filling in volume deficiencies that provide lasting results.</p><p>I have personal preference for Juvederm vs Restylane depending on the location but use a ton of both products and in the right hands you can accomplish just about anything!. (Lesley Rabach, MD, New York Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Juvederm or Restylane – they are similar, but different</em></p><p>Juvederm and restylane are hyaluronic acid fillers. Each brand has thicker, lifting fillers (Juvederm voluma and restylane lyft) and thinner, smoothing fillers (restylane silk or juvederm volbella) for fine lines. In general, your experienced injector is going to choose the right product for the job! If a patient comes in asking for a particular product or treatment, I always try to slow down the conversation and ask them about their concern.</p><p>Then we can have a conversation about the ways that we can address the concern.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_2109" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d8ace6a67b21721f2ef7d633adea7cca">

</div><p><em>These are some factors that I consider when choosing which filler:</em></p><ol>
<li>the task at hand – are we trying to lift or to smooth?</li>
<li>the patient’s skin – is it thick or thin? does the injected area have good structure or are we trying to recreate structure?</li>
<li>the patient’s preference for a particular brand.</li>
</ol><p>How long a filler lasts depends on many factors, including</p><ol>
<li>the type of filler</li>
<li>the quantity of filler,</li>
<li>the area that is injected</li>
<li>the patient’s metabolism of the product. (Melissa Chiang, MD, FAAD, Houston Dermatologic Surgeon)</li>
</ol><p>First off, it depends on the area you want treated. If it is the lips, I would personally recommend Restylane or Restylane Silk. Juvederm is nice to put into the lips as well, although I hear better results from the Restylane or Restylane silk.</p><p>Keep in mind that if you chose Restylane, swelling will be more significant. Swelling will only last a couple days. (Dhaval M. Patel, MD, Hoffman Estates Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Juvederm may last slightly longer than Restylane but this is not the most important thing to consider when deciding between these two products or decided which physician to see to get the injections. Many fillers that are not as desirable as either of the two aforementioned are permanent, but this is not always what is wanted.</p><p>More important is where each filler is placed and how the filler material behaves in different areas. The best thing is to consult a board certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon to see what would be best for you. (M. David Cole, MD, FAAD – Account Suspended, Newport Beach Dermatologist)</p></div>
