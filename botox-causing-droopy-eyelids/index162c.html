<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Droopy eyelids can rarely happen following Botox Injections. Nobody can actually guarantee that you won’t have this complication, because there can be occasional variations in a person’s muscle distribution width.</p><p>But to lower your risk, it is important that you have your injections done by an experienced Board Certified Dermatologic or Plastic Surgeon. (Eugene Mandrea, MD, Chicago Dermatologist)</p><p>BotoxCosmetic is, by far, the most common cosmetic treatment performed in the US and around the world. That is because it safe and has a very high patient satisfaction rate.</p><p>However, it is very important to remember that Botox is not just a product you buy, it is a treatment that requires experience, skill, and artistry.</p><p>You are much more likely to get a great result if you see a great doctor. I said that Botox is safe. However, any medication or treatment can have side effects and less than perfect results.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_327" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>Droopy eyelids were the most common side effect in the original FDA studies that were performed in order for the medication to be FDA approved. In those studies, there was a 4% incidence of droopy eyelids after treatment.</p><p>However, over the years cosmetic surgeons have gained a lot of experience and I am pretty sure if you asked most cosmetic surgeons they would tell you that the incidence of droopy eyelids is much less than 4%.</p><p>We have performed Botox treatments in our practice for over 20 years and can count the number of patients who developed a droopy eyelid on less than one hand.</p><p>You may want to check the official Allergan BotoxCosmetic website to read about all of the FDA warnings for Botox.</p><p>Please remember that Botox is used for many medical problems in addition to cosmetic treatments. Many of those medical treatment involve much higher doses, and involve injections in different locations, then what is done for cosmetic treatments.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_328" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-a02e3536d677ec7abba3c40f82b44f46">

</div><p>However the warnings are grouped together. They do not separate out treatments from Botox for cosmetic reasons. I would suggest that you discuss this issue with your cosmetic surgeon. He/She should be able to put this all into context and clearly deal with your concerns.</p><p>At that point you can decide if you are comfortable have a Botox treatment. (Marc Cohen, MD, Philadelphia Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Avoiding the Side Effects of Botox</b></p><p>The most import decision regarding Botox is to go to a physician and or injector with a long vast experience. The quality of your result and possible side effects are a direct result of the technique utilized during your Botox treatment.</p><p>This includes the dilution of saline to Botox, direction of injection, and the anatomical areas injected. Drooping of the eyelid, medically known as ptosis of the eyelid is a rare occurrence but is temporary and can be helped with eye drops prescribed by your physician.

</div><h4>Botox Safety</h4><p>The most important factor in safely and correctly administering Botox is to select a board-certified Dermatologist or Plastic Surgeon. Before choosing a physician, be sure to ask about their experience and training with Botox. Botox is very safe and the negative side effects, such as the droopy eyelid, can be avoided when injected by a trained physician. (Mark A. McCune, MD, Overland Park Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Tips to avoid side effects after botox</b></p><p>The most common side effect I see after botox (or dysport) is a small bruise at an injection site. If you are taking aspirin, ibuprofen or fish oil I would try to avoid it a week before your injection.</p><p>With proper technique of injection, I had not see complications with droopy eyelids. I do recommend no exercise for 24 hrs after the injection and not rubbing or massaging the areas of injection. If a droopy eyelid does happen, you can treat it with an eye drop and it usually short lived and self resolved.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_330" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>A more subtle but common concern I hear from my patients who are in their 50s is that they botox in their forehead done somewhere else and they experienced a brow drop. If your brows are already low, you will want to talk to your injector about how to get a lift in the brows (which might mean you don’t inject the area above the tail of the brow). (Myriam Loyo, MD, Portland Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Choose wisely</i></p><p>Most complications including bruising or a droopy lid are short in duration. You can never preclude all risks or complications; however, by choosing a surgeon who is familiar with the anatomy of the face and one who has an artistic eye, you will cut down some of the risk.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_331" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Look at the before and after photos on web sites and ask about how it it done by the physician. Always better to leave some motion in the upper face rather than have nothing move.</p><p>Likewise, Botox along the mouth or lower face has added potential risks that should be addressed. (Jeffrey S. Rosenthal, MD, Fairfield Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox side effects are typically minimal if they occur</strong></p><p>Botox side effects are typically minimal if they occur. One can avoid botox side effects by not asking or having excessive amounts placed at the initial or repeat injection time. Also, most of the side effects such as droopy eyelids can be avoided by going to experienced injectors; howevever, even in experienced hands this can sometimes occur.</p><p>If a droopy eyelid should occur, this problem can be temporarily corrected with naphcon eye drops when in public to help lift the droopy eyelids which is an over the counter eye drop. If there is asymmetry in the brow area from an injection, this can often be corrected with a botox touch-up in another location on the other side or just below the eyebrows. (Scott Trimas, MD, Jacksonville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_332" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-2e261d3092db92aaf89c5707a67fed8b">

</div><p><i>Avoiding Botox Side Effects</i></p><p>The best way to avoid Botox side effects is to have your treatment done by an experienced injector. In skilled hands, Botox is an extremely safe treatment. Probably the side effect that people worry about the most is drooping of the upper eyelid.</p><p>In my Denver office an eyelid droop would be an extremely rare event. If an eyelid droop were to occur, there are drops which can be used to help raise the eyelid. The good news is that any possible Botox side effect is temporary because the effects of Botox are temporary.</p><p>While a true eyelid droop is rare, it is more common to see brow ptosis or a lowering of the brow. This can occur if too much Botox is placed in the forehead or if treatment is performed too close to the brow.</p><p>When I treat the forehead for horizontal lines, I like to stay conservative with my dosing and to stay relatively high on the forehead with my injection sites. This usually works well to prevent brow ptosis.</p><p>Also I like to place a small amount of Botox at the lateral eyebrow which can help provide a subtle brow lift. Botox in skilled hands is one of the safest cosmetic treatments that I know of.</p><p>I have treated my family members and myself with Botox and I wouldn’t do this if I had any concerns about safety!. (Richard Ort, MD, Lone Tree Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Avoiding Botox Side Effects: Find an Experienced Injector! </em></p><p>Droopy eyelid will occur if too much Botox is placed too close to the orbital rim. This happens almost never in the hands of an experienced injector. Botox parties and Groupon Botox by marginal practitioners may lead to more complications.</p><p>Some bargains are not always bargains. Botox is one of the ‘cleanest’ drugs that I have ever prescribed. I am sure that is one of the reasons that it is the most popular cosmetic procedure in the United States. (Luke J. Curtsinger, MD, Savannah Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox can cause droopy eyelids if it is injected by a naïve or inexperienced injector into the muscles that elevate your eyebrows or eyelids. So as “expert injectors”, we avoid injecting in those areas which would likely cause a poor result.</p><p>That’s precisely why you should choose an experienced injector- a plastic surgeon or dermatologist who is experienced and specializes in using neuromodulators like Botox and Xeomin rather than choose your family doctor, gynecologist or dentist to treat you! Botox is both safe and effective when properly administered.</p><h4>Tips for first time botox:</h4><ol>
<li>Choose a plastic surgeon or dermatologist who is experienced and specializes in using neuromodulators like Botox and Xeomin rather than choose your family doctor, gynecologist or dentist to treat you!</li>
<li>Follow the after your treatment directions- such as avoiding massaging the areas treated -Minimize the chance of bruising with the injections by avoiding taking aspirin and ibuprofen and other over the counter or prescription medications that cause thinning of the blood for about two weeks prior to your treatment. (Steven Yarinsky, MD, Albany Plastic Surgeon)</li>
