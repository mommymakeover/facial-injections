<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Botox is category c ( unknown effects) so it is not recommended when pregnant or breastfeeding . It remains in your system for 90 days and can be transferred to breast milk. </p><p>If a treatment is performed retrospective analysis has not listed any linked adverse outcomes , but because studies can not be performed ethically it is labeled as “unknown effects”. (Drew Varano, MD, Washington DC Physician)</p><p>Botox should not be done while breastfeeding.  There is no way to know how long Botox stays in the body or its effect on an child breastfeeding.  (Jonathan Kulbersh, MD, Charlotte Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are no safety studies on Botox and its effects on breastfeeding and there never will be. </p><p>Wait until after you have finished breastfeeding prior to having Botox.

</div>Botox is a medication injected into target muscles to selectively weaken them to produce fewer and softer wrinkles in the face. 
<p>Although there are no scientific studies to prove that Botox should be avoided during breastfeeding, the general recommendation is to avoid Botox injections during pregnancy and breastfeeding for the safety of the baby.</p><p>It’s not worth the smallest risk when our children are exposed. Safety comes first. (Victor Chung, MD, San Diego Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There are no studies showing safety of Botox in breast feeding.  Since Botox is purely a cosmetic procedure, it is not worth the risk to your child of the unknown and you should not have Botox until after you complete breastfeeding.

<em>Safety of Botox during breast feeding</em><p>Getting Botox is not safe during breast feeding (it is not known if BOTOX® Cosmetic passes into breast milk). </p><p>Finish breast feeding before considering any neurotoxin injections. (Shanthala Shivananjappa, MD, Boston Physician)</p><p><i>Botox safe when breastfeeding?</i></p><p>No, it is not safe to do when breastfeeding. I would wait til you stop breastfeeding before you get treatment. </p><p>There are possible traces of the Botox in the bloodstream and milk and that wouldn’t be safe for the baby. (Steven F. Weiner, MD, Panama City Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox while breastfeeding</em></p><p>Botox has inadvertently been administered to many pregnant women without known ill effect but it has never been studied in pregnancy and should not knowingly be administered. Theoretically it would probably be worse in breast feeding because of the fear of some of the product being secreted in the breast milk.<br>

</div>Enjoy your baby and wait until you are done breastfeeding for your Botox. (Seth Kates, MD, Worcester Dermatologic Surgeon)
<p><strong>Is Botox safe while breastfeeding</strong></p><p>The safety of Botox has not been studied on breast feeding females, so I think it is best to wait until your are done with the breast feeding before having any neurotoxin. (Julio Garcia, MD, Las Vegas Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox treatments and breastfeeding</i></p><p>It is best to avoid any elective treatments while pregnant and breastfeeding. It is probably safe but I would avoid it since it has not been studies in some who are breastfeeding. (Scott Trimas, MD, Jacksonville Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Botox Should not be Used During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding</i></p><p>Botox exerts its effects locally however it has not been studied during pregnancy or during nursing. Therefore, most physicians will agree that Botox should not be used during pregnancy or while nursing. . (Hardik Soni, MD (not currently practicing), Summit Emergency Medicine Physician)<br>

<b>Botox and Pregnancy and Nursing Mothers</b><p>There are no studies done on Botox and pregnancy or breastfeeding therefore it is contraindicated. See section 8 of the product insert. (Jack Berdy, MD, New York Physician)</p><p>There are no studies of botox in pregnancy and breastfeeding but the general professional consensus is to avoid this treatment during breastfeeding. (Firas Al-Niaimi, MSc, London Dermatologist)</p><h3>Is Botox safe while breastfeeding? </h3><p>No. Avoid Botox when pregnant and breast feeding. There is concern about the effect of Botox on the developing muscle of the infant. (Brooke R. Seckel, MD, FACS, Boston Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>The short answer is that no one knows. I would wait until you are no longer breastfeeding. (Corey Frucht, MD, PhD, Santa Barbara Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>I would avoid getting Botox treatments if you are breast feeding.

<em>BOTOX while breastfeeding is not recommended</em><p>I can appreciate the excitement some new mothers have in either returning to taking care of themselves following a pregnancy or looking into treatments for the first time once they have gone through a pregnancy and childbirth.</p><p>However, it is not recommended during breastfeeding as it has not been studied (it would be unethical to do a study on mothers breastfeeding their newborns and having botox treatments!). Since we do not know for certain what the consequence can be for the child, we always behave cautiously and say that breastfeeding is a contraindication to BOTOX treatments. (Manish Khanna, MD, FRCP(C), Montreal Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Botox during breastfeeding</h4><p>There are no studies confirming the safety of Botox during pregnancy and breastfeeding. For that reason, I recommend that patient do not get Botox injection until after they have delivered and/or finished breastfeeding. (Shaun Patel, MD, Miami Physician)<br>

</div>Botox is contraindicated while pregnant and while breast feeding.  Would wait until you finish breast feeding until your next Botox treatment.  (Joseph Franklin, MD, Durham Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Due to the lack of study, it is automatically contraindicated in pregnant and breast feeding mothers. (Lawrence Bundrick, MD, Huntsville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>There were no trials done to study this matter, so we always recommend to exercise caution and stop using Botox when you are pregnant, trying to get pregnant or lactating. (Edward Fruitman, MD, New York Physician)</p><p>It is best to avoid all non necessary treatments and medications while pregnant.  Therefore, it is not recommended to have Botox treatments while pregnant. (Julia Ann Sullivan Miller, MD, Edison Ophthalmologist)</p><p> I do not recommend for my patients to have Botox done while they are still breastfeeding. It would be better to wait until you are done breastfeeding to proceed. The safety of Botox while breastfeeding is unknown, why risk it. (Francis Johns, MD, Greensburg Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Although it is not known if Botox passes into breast milk it is considered unsafe to use in women who are breast feeding or planning to breastfeed because of the possibility of very serious problems if the infant was exposed to Botox. (Renata Wix-Harris, MD, Livingston Physician)</p><p>I don’t recommend doing Botox treatment while you are breastfeeding.  The safety of Botox in this situation is unknown and it’s not worth it.  Just wait a few months until you are done breastfeeding. (Richard Ort, MD, Lone Tree Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>There are no clinical studies to support whether Botox is safe or not during breastfeeding, therefore it is generally recommended that you do not. Botox is cosmetic and not worth the potential risk to your child. (Neil Sadick, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p> Botox stays in your system for 90 days after injection. It is absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy or with breast feeding.  I would wait until you have completely weaned your child and then proceed with treatment at that time.</p><p> It is not worth the risk as true botulism can be fatal to your child. There have been no studies to ascertain safety and as a provider I absolutely would not treat in this situation. (Jasmine Mohadjer, MD, Tampa Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p></div>
