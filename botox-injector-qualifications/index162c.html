<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>Who is qualified to inject Botox? Any doctor can prescribe or inejct any medication. </p><p>However, those doctors that have been board certified in fields dealing with facial aesthetics are the most qualified (Plastic surgeons, oculoplastic surgeons, dermatologists, and facial plastic surgeons). (Steven Wallach, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Qualified to inject Botox</strong></p><p>It really is not a matter of who is allowed to adminster your Botox or Dysport treatment or any of the injectible fillers for that matter but who is qualified. It is true depending on the state you live in will determine who can legally inject your Botox or Dysport but it is more important as to the qualifications of the injector.</p><p></p>

</div>You should only trust a licensed, board certified plastic surgeon or dermatologist to inject your Botox, Dysport, or any of the wrinkle fillers. (Arnold Zweig, MD (retired), Atlanta Facial Plastic Surgeon)
<h4>Have Botox and Dysport injected by a doctor</h4><p>Although a variety of non-physicians currently inject Botox, I feel that physicians who are well-versed in facial anatomy are better qualified. </p><p>One key problem is that many non-physician injectors follow a standard template when performing injections.</p><p>Unfortunately, not every patient’s facial muscle anatomy and wrinkle lines follow the standard template. The ability to customize injection sites, dosages, and type of botulinum (Botox versus Dysport) allows more latitude in reducing facial wrinkles and achieving the desired results. (Ronald Friedman, MD, Plano Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>Have your Botox injected by a Specialist</h4><p>Although any doctor or their health care delegate may be allowed to inject Botox, why would you not want an expert who is properly qualified and credentialed to do your treatment?<br>

</div>Board certified Plastic, ENT and Oculoplastic Surgeons as well as most Dermatologists have the training and knowledge to decide when and how to optimize your treatment. (Mathew C. Mosher, MD, Vancouver Plastic Surgeon)
<p>The law says that any licensed MD can inject Botox. It is important to realize, however, that the law (as Dr. Beraka has stated) is a truly minimal standard. </p><p>If you want a reliable good result, with minimal risk (yes, there ARE risks to Botox treatments- all of which can be reduced by having the treatment performed by the right provider), you should absolutely be certain you see a Board Certified Dermatologist or Plastic Surgeon. (Armando Soto, MD, FACS, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox and credentials</h3><p>In seeking to get a medical procedure performed it is always best to consult a board certified physician/dermatologist who understands facial anatomy and has experience doing the procedure.  You should use the same standards you would use with any other medical procedure to get the best care. (Michele S. Green, MD, New York Dermatologist)<br>

</div><h5>Big difference between who can provide medical treatments, and who should be doing it</h5><p>Although regulations regarding medical treatments vary by state, it makes more sense to have a well trained professional providing care. Surgeons who operate on the brow, and are intimately familiar with te anatomy of the muscles, and individual variations, are best qualified to recommend and provide the best treatment for facial wrinkles or lines.</p><p>Remember, if your only tool is a hammer, the whole world looks like a nail. (Michael H. Rosenberg, MD, Mount Kisco Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox injections only by an expert.</b></p><p>Forget what the law says about who can inject Botox. The law is a minimal standard. Go to a board certified plastic surgeon or dermatologist. (George J. Beraka, MD (retired), Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>
<i>Who should inject botox</i><p>Botox should be injected by physician whose specialty and training is devoted to some degree of aesthetic medicine such as board-certified dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and ent/oculoplastic surgeons. You will see that there are many non-physicians injecting botox which can be very risky because there are certainly complications that can occur.</p><p>The above mentioned physicians are familiar with the anatomy in which botox in injected and have the appropriate skills and training to handle the complications. </p><p>Remember, you get what you pay for. (Ritu Saini, MD, New York Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Physicians should inject Botox</i></p><p>I think a better question is “Who SHOULD inject Botox?” Actual laws will vary by state and different professional societies have varying guidelines. But the fact of the matter is, you want the best results in the safest means possible.<br>

</div>We recommend that prior to any Botox treatment, you be properly evaluated and educated by a physician who is Board Certified (www.abms.org) in an accepted aesthetic field, such as Dermatology, Plastic Surgery, or Ophthalmology.
<p>Additionally, be sure the physician has extensive experience with Botox and other injectables (such as fillers), has an excellent reputation in your community, and that they are someone you trust! As and example, Dermatologist obtain 3 years of experience and education with Botox prior to entering practice.</p><p>Unfortunately, we see more and more poorly trained physicians attempting (or delegating to poorly trained staff!) cosmetic procedures. Often these physicians have learned their technique over a weekend course or “on the fly”. Remember, no amount of savings is worth a bad cosmetic outcome.<br>

</div>Botox is a wonderful treatment that our patients rave about, and we want your experience to be the same. (Jeffrey C. Poole, MD, Metairie Dermatologic Surgeon)
<p><i>Botox injections by a physician</i></p><p>Botox should be administered by a trained, board-certified physician, preferably a dermatologist or plastic surgeon. It is important for the injector to have a good understanding of facial anatomy and the intricate workings of the involved muscles.</p><p>In the hands of a skilled physician, Botox injections can then be tailored to each individual based on their specific needs. (Alison Stallings, MD, Tarrytown Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox and Dysport should be injected by a physician expert</h3><p>You can get Botox almost anywhere these days…but you shouldn’t. Just because someone does offer Botox, that doesn’t mean they do it well. Botox and Dysport are great treatments! But you have to do your homework.<br>

</div>I recommend only being injected by a physician…in fact, only by a physician who is one of the “core 4” aesthetic physicians, which include Dermatologists, Facial Plastic Surgeons, Plastic Surgeons, or Occuloplastic surgeons. And when you’re in the office of one of these types of physicians, make sure the doctor does the injections. (Chad L. Prather, MD, Baton Rouge Dermatologic Surgeon)
<p><strong>Seek an expert for Botox</strong></p><p>Botox is a medicine that can only be purchased by a physician. Any physician can purchase Botox, but that does not mean the physician necessarily has the proper training in adminstering Botox.</p><p>Botox can have side effects and complications. Dermatologists and Facial Plastic Surgeons have an expertise in the anatomy of the face. In order to minimize complications and side effects from Botox, I would recommend you seek treatment from a specialist.</p><p>I have seen droopy eyelids from patients who were injected at a “medispa” by a “trained tech.” I would be highly skeptical and do your homework on who is doing the injections and how they have been trained. (Mandy Lynn Warthan, MD, Dallas Dermatologist)</p><p><b>Botx by Core Trained Physicians</b></p><p>For best results and consistency of results, Botox should be administered by a core trained physician. This means surgeons trained in effects of Botox around the eyes and the brow: a Facial Plastic Surgeon, Plastic Surgeon, Dermatologist, or Occuloplastic surgeon. (Stephen Prendiville, MD, Fort Myers Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Go to a Dermatologist or Plastic Surgeon for Botox</h5><p>Botox is a medication that can only be purchased by a physician, but many medical personnel can legally administer the injections. Just like any other medical procedure, injections come with some risk of complications. If you want to minimize your risk of an adverse event, make sure the individual injecting you has the proper background and medical training, ie, go to a Dermatologist or Plastic Surgeon. (Richie L. Lin, MD, Summit Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h5>The law varies on who can inject Botox</h5><p>Any physician can purchase Botox, since its a medication. There are many marginally trained physicians injecting Botox because it is a fee-for-service practice. However, you should seek out a clinic staffed by board certified plastic surgeons and does a lot of Botox injections.</p><p>In these busy plastic surgery clinics, there are often a few RNs and PAs injecting under the direct supervision of a plastic surgeon. Like everything, injectors get better with multiple patient contacts per day. Seek out a clinic that does over a dozen Botox injections per day.</p><p>More than likely, such a clinic has some very experienced injectors with a physician on-site supervising their work. (Scott C. Sattler, MD, FACS, Seattle Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
