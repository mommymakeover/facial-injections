<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><i>Botox Results Following Treatment</i></p><p>It typically takes anywhere from 5-7 days for Botox to begin working completely. Some patients will notice results even sooner, but most patients experience the full effect closer to a week following injections. </p><p>There is no exact limit as to how frequently injections can be performed. As far as how long it can be repeated, many patients have been treated regularly for many years. </p><p>In fact, several patients of my practice who have been undergoing injections for several years require less frequent and lower-dose injections because of progressive smoothing from continued regular Botox injections. (Jeffrey Ridha, MD, Saratoga Springs Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox Results</strong></p><p></p>

</div>This varies patient to patient. It can take effect as little as 2-3 days for some patients. However, most patients see significant change after 5-7 days. It is good to re-evalute at 2 weeks to see if there is a need for additional injections. (Stephanie Beidler Teotia, MD, Dallas Plastic Surgeon)
<p><b>Timing of Botox Results</b></p><p>Results from Botox typically can be seen between 3-7 days after treatment. The results last between 3-6 months, 4 on average. </p><p>There is no limit as to how long one can receive treatments. (Nicholas Tarola, MD, Nashville Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>It only takes a few days</em></p><p>Botox begins to work within days, in general it takes about 7-10 days for it to take full effect. In our office we have found that the newer neurotoxin Xeomin takes between 4-7 days to take full effect, which we attribute to the more pure formula without the unneeded proteins.</p><p>With both neurotoxins you will see a gradual softening of the lines beginning around the second or third day after you have been injected.<br>

</div>With most other injectables it is a good idea to wait two weeks and reevaluate to see if you need any additional product. We prefer to inject conservatively and then go back and inject a little more later. (Barry E. DiBernardo, MD, Montclair Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Some patients see results in a day or two, but it takes two weeks to see the final results. The treatment intervals can vary, most people treat anywhere from three to six months. (Marla L. McClaren, MD, Sacramento Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Time for Botox to work</h4><p>I tell my patients not to expect any change for at least 2-3 days. The peak effect of muscle relaxation and wrinkle reduction is in place by 2 weeks. In the majority of patients, Botox works for 3-4 months. (Clyde Mathison, MD, Knoxville Facial Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Typically patients can see results as early as 3 days following Botox, but for the full effect is not offen seen until one week following teh injection. (Farzad Yaghouti, MD, San Diego Ophthalmologist)
<p><i>Dysport works faster than Botox</i></p><p>Botox generally starts working within a week, but for patients who want a quicker result, I usually recommend Dysport, since it starts working at around 3 days. Both products tend to last between 3 and 5 months for the average patient.</p><p>There is no “limit” to how long one can keep getting these injections. (David P. Rapaport, MD, FACS, Manhattan Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><b>Botox effect usually appears in 3 days</b></p><p>The effects of Botox usually appears about 3 days after treatment. First time patients may require reapplication or “touch up” 1 week after if not completely satisfied with the results. Once the surgeon knows the patient’s standard dose, Botox effect generally appears in 3 days as mentioned before. (John Mesa, MD, New York Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>Although some patients will see results within as few as 4 to 6 hours we generally say that patients should wait 14 days to see the final result of a Botox treatment. I always bring my patients back at two weeks after injection to see the results at that point. (Mathew A. Plant, MD, FRCSC, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)
<p>Typically it takes seven to ten days to see the full results of the Botox treatrment. It is possible to see the effects much sooner. There is no limit to the time you can keep getting Botox. (Gary Lawton, MD, FACS, San Antonio Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>It usually takes 10 to 14 days to see the full effect of botox. The first time you botox you should see that the wrinkles you are treating do not get deeper when you make a facial expression.<br>

</div>You will appreciate this result but with repetitive injections the results get even better as the muscles weaken and the wrinkles remodel with your bodies collagen. I recommend every three months for injections if you want the maximal results.
<p>After a year or two the botox treatments can be spread out to every 6 to 12 months depending on the individual. This can be kept up indefinitely and maintains a less wrinkled youthful look. (Katrinka L. Heher, MD, Boston Oculoplastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>Time for Botox to take effect</i></p><p>Most patients will start to see an effect within 3-5 days but some patients will need additional time. There is no limit to the number of times you can receive Botox. (William Andrade, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><h5>Botox effects</h5><p>For most of our patients we tell them to give it 3-7 days before they see the effects. Occasionally someone with heavy muscles may take even longer, but that is rare. We have had many patients who have had Botox for over 5 years without any issues. (Francisco Canales, MD, Santa Rosa Plastic Surgeon)<br>

</div>
<strong>Give BOTOX Time to Develop</strong><p>I’ve heard some of my BOTOX patients say they start to see some improvement after only a couple of days, but it takes a bit longer for most people. It’s generally accepted that it takes about 7 to 10 days before full results are apparent.</p><p>At this point, you should see a significant improvement in the wrinkles that were treated. Repeated injections of BOTOX spaced several months apart have not been shown to be harmful, and there’s no reason that you can’t undergo injections indefinitely.</p><p>Although more research is needed, anecdotal evidence suggests that people who regularly undergo BOTOX treatments often enjoy longer-lasting results, eventually spacing their appointments more than 4 months apart. (Howard Silverman, MD, FRCSC, Ottawa Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Two weeks to see full effects of Botox</em><br>

</div>While some patients will notice a benefit from Botox within 24 hours, for most it takes several days. It generally takes 2 weeks before on can be sure they are seeing the full effect. I generally recommend patients wait this 2 weeks before being to critical about their results.
<p>Long term use of Botox is well tolerated and actually has a beneficial effect in preventing wrinkle formation. </p><p>As long as one is tolerating the treatments well, patients can continue with Botox treatments their entire life. (Mark Hamilton, MD, Indianapolis Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox can take a few days</h3><p>Results for Botox are usually apparent by 2-5 days. Results for other injectible neurotoxins such as Dysport or Xeomin though not exactly the same, are similar. The effects last between 3-5 months. Documented adverse side effects to continual use of Botox are lacking. (David J. Myers, MD, Salt Lake City Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><em>Botox Onset and How Long it Lasts.</em></p><p>Botox takes about 2 days to start seeing the effect with 5 days until the full effect. This may vary with areas of injection and amount of injection (number of units). Botox does last about 3 to 4 months.</p><p>Repetitive treatment can cause muscle atrophy and long lasting results if the muscles are kept paralyzed. There is no limit to the number of times you get Botox, but as you age the effects may seem less and less because of the thinning skin.</p><p>Global skin care is important to combine with Botox treatments for facial lines and wrinkles. (Andrew P. Trussler, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>In most of my patients, an improvement in the strength of the muscle contraction that we injected is noticeable in 3-5 days. Nearly 100% of patients will see their final result by 2 weeks. I always tell my patients that followup with the injector is essential to a good result if the final appearance and outcome at 2 weeks is not what they had hoped.</p><p>An experienced injector can fine tune results in those cases to achieve the desired result. (Brian K. Brzowski, MD, FACS, Ogden Plastic Surgeon)</p><h4>See Your Results Within 1-2 Weeks</h4><p>You will notice you have limited movement in the area where the Botox was injected within 1-2 weeks after the injection. Depending on the severity, the wrinkle will continue to improve in appearance over the next several months. (David L. Robbins, MD, FACS, West Des Moines Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
