</div>Mesolifting is a method of tightening the face skin based on mesotherapy. This is a rejuvenating procedure that can bring back the elasticity and smoothness of the aging skin without surgical intervention.
<p>Mesolifting is carried out by courses of repeated hypodermic injections of hyaluronic acid supplemented with vitamin mesococtails. </p><p>This procedure is not a separate method or a separate technique, but the commercial name of mesotherapy with the use of drugs aimed at improving skin turgor and hydration.</p><p>Getting into the deep layers of the skin, hyaluronic acid starts the processes of regeneration and renewal of skin structures, active cell division and metabolic processes in the skin. </p><p>Hyaluronic acid is a “life-giving substance”, which is synthesized by our body, is part of many biological fluids and regulates the water balance of tissues. Over the years, the amount of hyaluronic acid in the body decreases, tissues suffer from dehydration, which immediately affects the appearance of the skin.</p><p>The use of drugs based on hyaluronic acid helps to compensate for its loss and trigger the synthesis of endogenous (own) hyaluronate. Also, with this method, processes are triggered that stimulate the recovery processes in the dermis, the extracellular matrix is a recolonized, the skin relief is restored and updated, wrinkles are smoothed and the complexion is improved. </p><p>The use of drugs based on hyaluronic acid helps to compensate for its loss and trigger the synthesis of endogenous (own) hyaluronate.</p><p></p>

<h3>Botox injections</h3><p>Botox is a botulinum toxin preparation that can block neuromuscular impulses. The preparations of botulinum toxin are a weakened toxin that is produced by the vital activity of Clostridium botulinum bacteria. In the course of botulinum therapy, the connection between the signals of the motor nerve and the muscle involved in the formation of wrinkles is blocked.</p><p>Injection of preparations based on botulinum toxin helps to smooth out wrinkles and prevent the appearance of new ones. Despite the fact that botulinum toxin is a poison, there have never been observed toxic reactions in patients.</p><p>It is this injection technique that causes the most controversy and controversy. In order to decide to conduct this procedure, you need to know all the pros and cons of this method. It should be noted that Botox injections do not contribute to the disappearance of wrinkles, as many believe.</p><p>This is far from the case. Botox injections only temporarily paralyze the muscles, not allowing them to shrink and, thereby, contribute to smoothing wrinkles. The effect of the filler persists for half a year, after which beauticians recommend repeating the procedure. On average, it is considered optimal to conduct botulinum three times a year.</p><p></p>

</div>After a while the patient gets rid of the habit of actively using facial expressions, which, in turn, contributes to solving the problem without using botox. With regular botulinum therapy, you can forget for ever “goose paws”, wrinkles on the forehead and in the corners of the mouth. 
<p>Muscles are maintained in a relaxed state, which helps to smooth wrinkles of any depth and prevents the formation of new ones.</p><p>Botulinum toxin are absolutely safe and do not pose a threat to the life and health of the patient. The effect of the drug lasts 2-8 months, and the neurotoxin at the end of this time is completely eliminated from the body.</p><p>In order to cause a toxic reaction in the patient, the body needs to enter a dose that is thousands of times greater than cosmetic. So the alarm about the toxicity of botox can be immediately discarded.</p><p>However, there are areas on the face where botulinum therapy does not effectively eliminate wrinkles. This is the area of the cheeks and chin. In this case, combined treatment with botulinum toxin and biopolymer gel (silicone), which effectively copes with the task.</p><p>Botox injections are carried out with thin needles that leave no traces on the skin. Treatment is simple quick and highly effective. For this reason, this method was called “lunch”, as it allows to conduct sessions of botulinum therapy at lunchtime.</p><p>Botulinotherapy, like any other invasive therapy, has a number of contraindications. It is not recommended to inject Botox in the following cases:</p><ul>
<li>autoimmune and oncological diseases;</li>
<li>chronic diseases in the acute phase;</li>
<li>pregnancy and lactation;</li>
<li>acute infectious diseases;</li>

</div>How is the facial contouring performed? The hyaluronic gel is injected under the skin in small doses to create a volume under the skin. Thus, wrinkles rise, creating new contours of the face in a natural way.
<h4>Facial Contouring helps:</h4><ul>
<li>the formation of a clear elastic facial contours;</li>
<li>filling the skin dips;</li>
<li>improvement of its relief;</li>
<li>smoothing wrinkles;</li>

</div>Platelets give rise to growth factors in damaged tissues that stimulate cell division and growth. Growth factors are peptide and steroid hormones capable of stimulating growth, proliferation (proliferation of tissue through cell division) and differentiation (the process of formation of specialized cells) of living cells.
<p>How is the vampire lifting procedure performed? The patient is taking a small amount of blood from the vein into a sterile tube. </p><p>Then place the tube in a special apparatus, called a centrifuge separator, which divides the blood into plasma enriched with platelets and erythrocyte mass. The resulting plasma is administered subcutaneously to the patient. As a result of this innovative technique, the skin regenerates and its natural rejuvenation. The patient’s face improves, the skin becomes hydrated and nourished, pigmentation spots and wrinkles disappear, and a significant lifting is observed.</p><p></p>

</div>This injection technique is also remarkable by the fact that it helps to rejuvenate not only the skin of the face, but also the body as a whole. Preparations based on the placenta are used in complex programs to improve the functioning of the immune system and normalize all functions of the body’s vital functions.
<p>Notice the effect of harmonization of all systems of the body caused by placenta.</p><p>Despite the fact that preparations based on the human placenta are obtained by multi-stage molecular fractionation (separation) and, therefore, have a high degree of purification, there are cases of individual incompatibility and rejection of the pharmacological drug.

</div>Over the years, the facial skin loses its elasticity, due to this there is a deformative ptosis. Unfortunately, this process does not depend on the person and is beyond his control. The ptosis of the face is caused by two factors: gravity and age.
<p>Weakened with age, the skin is attracted to the ground, which causes its complete deformation. </p><p>The technique of face reinforcement is able to eliminate this unpleasant age defect of the skin, restore the face of the former oval and firmness.</p><p>Reinforcement of the face is known in cosmetology for a long time. Once this procedure was carried out with the help of gold threads. Now in the reinforcement of active drugs are:</p><ul>
<li>hyaluronic biogel;</li>
<li>polylactic acid;</li>
<li>3D meso-threads.</li>

<p>Polylactic acid is used to fill deep creases, most often nasolabial, wrinkles on the chin and folds around the mouth (puppet lines). Polylactic acid in fillers acts deeper and more active, for this reason it is twice the duration of hyaluronic fillers. Reinforcement with polylactic acid promotes the synthesis of new collagen and the filling of dermal areas with new fibers that make the skin more elastic.</p><p>The only inferior polylactic acid hyaluronate is in the number of procedures performed.</p><p>Injections with hyaluronic biogel are single-shot procedure, and treatment with polylactic acid requires tactics of stage-by-stage holding.

</div>The method of reinforcing 3D mesothreads (thread lifting) came to us from South Korea. This is a kind of thread facelift, contributing to the creation of a skin framework from endogenous (own) collagen. The technology of thread lifting eliminates cosmetological skin defects, which until recently were considered the prerogative of purely plastic surgery. But, frankly, experts who own this innovative technology is not so much.

Meso threads are injected into the subcutaneous fat layer of the skin in the form of a mesh.</p><p>Subtle needles slide easily under the skin, minimally injuring the tissue. </p><p>On the back stroke of the needle, the thread is separated from the conductor and remains under the skin 180-200 days.</p><p></p>

Hyaluronic acid is called a molecular sponge because of its ability to bind water.

It becomes clear why hyaluronic acid is so highly valued in cosmetology.</p><p>Biorevitalization with hyaluronate is also good because, it can be used if the process of wrinkle formation only begins. This injection technique starts the processes of skin regeneration and rejuvenation, stimulates the production of endogenous hyaluronic acid, collagen and elastin, activates blood microcirculation and saturates the tissues with moisture.</p><p></p>
