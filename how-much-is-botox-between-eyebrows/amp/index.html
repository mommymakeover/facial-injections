<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p>The average cost for a Botox treatment depends on the area being treated.</p><p>The most common area that is treated with Botox is the area between the eyebrows, also known as ‘11 lines.’</p><p>Patients using Botox to treat 11 lines will typically receive 25 units in this area. In NYC, this usually costs around $400.</p><p>Pricing also varies from one practice to another. In New York, the price per unit will often vary depending on the practice and injector.</p><p>Botox in NYC can be as low as $8/unit and can even be found for free at certain training centers. (Stephen P. Bracci, MD, New York Physician)</p><p>The cost for Botox depends upon the location and the qualifications of the injector. In my area the charge is usually 10 – 15 dollars per unit and it takes about 25 units to treat the forehead and the glabella (the area between the eyebrows).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1633" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>In addition the charge will be on the higher end for board certified Plastic Surgeons to inject the botox. (Thomas Guillot, MD, Baton Rouge Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Botox price varies by practice, geography and number of units utilized</strong></p><p>Certainly Botox is a very reasonable treatment to begin with to improve expression lines around your eyes and forehead, to help shape your eyebrows and to help add fullness and shape to your lips (along with fillers in that area).</p><p>You will find that prices vary depending on the practice and the geographic area. Also, depending on how many areas you treat (frown lines, forehead lines, crows feet, lip area) and how severe your lines are, that will determine how many units are needed and thus the charge.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1634" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>A bottle of 100 units costs the physician about $500+. Typically 10-20 units or more may be utilized for each area and the charge for treatment can range from $300-800 or more depending on all the above factors.</p><p>Most offices should be able to give you a fairly good idea of the charge, but it will take a one-on -one consultation with the physician to assess your individual condition, to decide if Botox is right for you and how much you may require.</p><p>You should have a detailed evaluation and explanation prior to treatment, and then an opportunity to follow-up with the office to gauge your result. This will help to assure your satisfaction, and determine if perhaps more is needed or whether an alternative/adjunctive treatment such as a filler injection is indicated. (David J. Levens, MD, Coral Springs Plastic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1635" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-b4ce11390ef852fc1df830de3566001b">

</div><p>Botox prices vary depending on the skill level of the injector, and also on the particular product injected.</p><p>I have seen a range from $8.50/unit to $15/unit, with discounts given for higher volumes. Our office charges $10 / unit if the patient choose to “bank” their Botox (buy a larger quantity upfront, which lasts multiple treatments).</p><p>Often, the manufacturer gives coupons via “Brilliant Distinctions” loyalty program which can be applied toward future purchases.</p><p>Sometimes Botox can be charged per area injected. Botox can be diluted in ways to make it seem effective for a given area, but it may not last as long.</p><p>Other alternatives to Botox such as Dysport and Xeomin may have different prices. Smaller body parts require fewer units (eyebrow lift or upper lip = 5 units) whereas larger body parts require much more (neck bands, up to 30-40 units).</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1636" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Men tend to require a higher number of units, since their muscles are larger. The good news is that if you get Botox regularly, you can train your muscles not to over-express, which then allows you to wait longer between treatments.</p><p>Getting Botox can prevent the wrinkles from becoming “fixed” or permanent at rest. (Joanna Chan, MD, Long Beach Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>The Price of Beauty</strong></p><p>There is a large price range Botox injection. There are many reasons why the cost can vary but the cost should depend on the amount of Botox needed to treat the individual patient.</p><p>Botox works by temporarily paralyzing the muscle groups that cause the appearance of deep lines/ wrinkles.</p><p>People with more muscle need more Botox. In general men have more dense muscle on the forehead and between the eyebrows and require a greater quantity of Botox than women to get the proper result. (Sharon Scherl, MD, Englewood Dermatologist)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1637" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The cost of Botox varies in every office and preference of the doctor. Dentist offices usually charge less, but in my preference I think getting it done by a professional doctor seems more appropriate. In our office we charge $15 a unit. (Joanne Mayhew, DO, Olympia Physician)</p><p><em>Botox Pricing in Kelowna, BC</em></p><p>Botox pricing varies according to injector expertise including skill, technique, understanding of anatomy and beauty as well as geographical location of clinic. (Praven Chetty, MD, Kelowna Physician)</p><h3>Botox Cost in Fairfield County, Connecticut.</h3><p>We charge Botox Cosmetic by the area. The three most common areas are the crow’s feet, forehead, and the lines in-between the brows (glabella). We use approximately 60 units for those 3 areas depending on the individuals needs.</p><h4>Our prices are:</h4><ul>
<li>Botox $229.00 per area</li>
<li>Dysport $199.00 per area. (Alfred Sofer, MD, FACS, Fairfield Plastic Surgeon)</li>
</ul><p><b>Experience is More Important than Cost</b></p><p>The price of Botox varies from clinic to clinic and can be dependent upon the expertise and experience of the injector. It is important to research clinics based upon the ability and track record of the injector and not just solely upon the cost of the treatment.</p><p>Here at The Plastic Surgery Clinic, we offer free Botox consultations with our skincare nurses to help you make the informed decision of choosing an injector. (Frank Lista, MD, Toronto Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox treatments cost $10 per unit in my office and all injections are done by me. I feel strongly that the only fair way to charge for Botox treatments is pricing by the unit and then the patients know exactly what they are getting and paying for. (Mitchell Schwartz, MD, South Burlington Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1639" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>This depends on where you live, most fees are between $9 to $15 per unit. You will find some charge by the area, but I prefer the per unit price so patients know exactly what they are getting.</p><p>Just for example, at $10 per unit for two treatment areas (ex. eyebrows and forehead), most patients will pay between $300 to $600 for their Botox treatment. Always remember, you get what you pay for and seek the care of an experienced physician injector. (E. John Serrao, MD, Orlando OB-GYN)</p><p>There are several different ways to charge for Botox, most commonly by area or per unit. My practice charges $12/unit. The average units used per area is 10-20 units. The most common areas for Botox treatments are between the eyebrows, forehead, and crows feet. (Dennis Hurwitz, MD, FACS, Pittsburgh Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>Botox Pricing Considerations</h3><p>The price of Botox injections depends on a few different things. Some physicians price Botox per area, while other’s price their injections per unit. I prefer to price Botox per unit because it allows me to customize treatments for each of my patients.</p><p>I find that it’s also beneficial for patients because they pay for the exact amount of units that are used during their treatment as opposed to paying a flat rate for an area (where the number of units used can vary from person to person).</p><p>The cost also depends on how experienced the injector is. You can find very in-expensive Botox, but beware that you often get what you pay for. Side effects like droopy eyelids can come with being injected by a less qualified physician.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_1638" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>Experienced physicians may recommend against using Botox in certain areas, such as forehead for people who are predisposed to droopy brows. The injecting doctor needs to analyze your face to come up with a comprehensive plan that may include other treatments or no treatments at all.</p><p>I recommend doing research to find a Botox expert in your area who will take time to assess you and answer your questions. (Babak Azizzadeh, MD, Beverly Hills Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>We charge Botox Cosmetic injections by the unit. As a rule of thumb, 20 units of Botox is needed per area. That will cover the forehead, for example. To add in between the eyebrows, add another 20 units, etc.</p><p>In our office, Botox costs $10 per unit, and we have three injectors other than myself who can perform this treatment. (Jeffrey W. Hall, MD, Austin Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>Botox injected by a physician will cost around $10-14 a unit, depending on the area of the country you are in. We generally charge $10/unit. The average patient in my practice receives 30-50 units to treat the brow/forehead area and crow’s feet.</p><p>I do all my own injections and recommend anyone looking for Botox to see a physician with facial plastic surgery training.
